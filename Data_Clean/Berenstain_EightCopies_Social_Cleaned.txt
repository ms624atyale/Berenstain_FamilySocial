3 1981 sitter what’s this said papa bear as he took the day’s mail from the bear family’s mailbox it was a notice telling about an important meeting that night at the bear country town hall mama bear called up grizzly gran brother and sister bear sometimes stayed with gramps and gran when mama and papa bear had to be away but gramps and gran were planning to go to the meeting too so brother and sister couldn’t stay with them or with aunt maude or cousin wilbur they were going to the meeting too why can’t we go with you asked sister beginning to get a little upset yeah added brother bear because said papa this meeting is for grown-ups and besides it won’t be over until late way past your bedtime well where are we going to stay the cubs wanted to know you’re going to stay right here said mama as she put down the phone alone asked sister of course not said mama i’ve arranged for a sitter a sitter said brother who is it going to be sister asked mrs grizzle who lives in the hollow stump at the end of the road said mama feeling much better about the whole thing mrs grizzle said the cubs not feeling better at all once when sister was playing with her friend their ball went into mrs grizzle’s flower garden mrs grizzle wasn’t too happy about it and another time when brother was flying his kite it swooped and bumped mrs grizzle on the hat she wasn’t too tickled about that either later that evening after the supper things has been cleaned up mama and papa got ready to go to the town meeting but who’s going to scrub our backs read us a story and tuck us in asked sister still a little nervous about the idea of a sitter i understand that mrs grizzle has raised seven cubs of her own said mama putting on her hat and i’m sure she’s a perfectly good back scrubber story reader and tucker-inner she’s not going to scrub my back brother bear said under his breath mrs grizzle came walking up the path to the bear’s tree house right on time there was no question about it it was the same mrs grizzle who got bopped with the kite and didn’t like cubs tromping her flowers she was very large almost as bi as papa and she carried a drawstring bag evening’ all said mrs grizzle in a loud jolly voice well time’s a-wastin’ you two she said to mama and papa you better skedaddle off to your meetin’ mrs grizzle had a strong way of saying things and folks usually did what she said mama and papa kissed the cubs good night and skedaddled whew said mrs grizzle as she sat down in papa’s big chair it sure is good to get a load off your feet she took off her hat and looked into her drawstring bag there’s something about somebody looking into a bag that makes cubs very curious mrs grizzle said sister yes what’s in the bag nothin’ much just somethings i take along when i go sittin’ a piece of string a pack of cards meanwhile over at the town hall the bears were getting ready for their important meeting they were getting ready for speeches voting and arguments about some new laws but mama’s mind was not on the meeting neither was papa’s mama and papa bear were thinking about what was going on back home sister looked a little worried when we left fretted mama so did brother agreed papa they decided to call home and see how things were going things are goin’ just fine said mrs grizzle brother and sister can’t come to the phone right now they’re busy playin’ cat’s cradle have a good meeting shouted the cubs  but they say to have a good meeting after cat’s cradle they played go fish with the cards that came out of mrs grizzle’s drawstring bag then they played tiddly-winks with a special set of winks that mrs grizzle had made out of polished stones and a snail-shell cup after a while the cubs got the yawns and mrs grizzle began getting them ready for bed and she did indeed turn out to be a very good back scrubber brother changed his mind about not having his back scrubbed and she was a find story reader and a really super tucker-inner i hope mama and papa had a good meeting said sister with a yawn because we had a very good sit the cubs had a number of different sitters from time to time but mrs grizzle was their favorite and they were always glad to see her  the bear family important meeting tonight town hall meeting  7 1982 go to camp  it was the last day of school and the beginning of vacation that wonderful time when little bears could sit around doing absolutely nothing brother bear and sister bear shouted good-bye to teacher jane and hopped onto the bus for the happy trip home well asked mama bear after a day or so of vacation are you enjoying sitting around doing nothing it’s great said sister absolutely said brother there’s just one trouble with it added sister there’s nothing to do here’s take a look at this said mama as she reached for something that had come in the mail this is what it looked like  some of the things looked interesting but brother wondered what fully supervised meant and sister wasn’t so sure about that overnight sleep-out it sounded a little scary where is this camp asked sister not far answered mama how will we get there brother wanted to know a bus comes for you in the morning and brings you home in the afternoon sounds a little like school said brother we’ll think about it said the cubs and went back to doing nothing well not exactly nothingthey picked a few wildflowers turned over a few rockschased a few butterflies  and thought about it mama could we try grizzly bob’s day camp just to see if we like it they asked of course said mama a couple of mornings later brother and sister were in camp shorts and t-shirts all ready and waiting when the bus came it didn’t look much like the school bus and grizzly bob didn’t look much like teacher jane and the camp didn’t look anything like school grizzly bob had built his camp beside a lake at the edge of the forest there were log buildings a flagpole flying the camp flag a big bulletin board with the camp rules there certainly were a lot of rules some interesting paths a roped-in place to swimthere was even a big red canoe bod had made name tags fo the cubs you’re campmates now so you better get to know each other he said then he took them on a tour of the camp there was an office with a desk where he did his paperwork and first-aid corner full of bandages and things for cubs and cruises there was a rec hall to go into when it rained rec was short for recreation there was a picnic place and a barbecue pit where they roasted hot dogs for lunch sister burned hers a little but she traded with another cub who liked burned hot dogs bob announced that after lunch they would all climb up spook hill to the very top of skull rock the special place where they would have their end-of-camp powwow and sleep-out it was quite a climb that evening mama and papa bear were eager to know how the cubs liked camp it was okay said brother but they sure have a lot of rules it was all right agreed sister they sure have plenty of bandages and stingy stuff for cuts but what they were both thinking about was skull rock and that end-of-camp sleep-out especially sister the second day was different brother had a great day he passed the swimming test and was allowed to ride in the canoe sister didn’t have such a good day she played dodge ball ad some of the cubs threw pretty hard the third day sister had fun she got a star for a birch picture frame she made in arts and crafts but brother hurt his knee in the wheelbarrow race the fourth day both of them had fun and every day after that so much fun that they forgot about skull rock and the sleep-out  almost papa found the sleeping bags that he and mama had used on their honeymoon and when the camp bus came on the morning of the big night brother and sister were readysort of the climb up spooky hill wasn’t so hard this time even with backpacks the cubs were strong and tough from their summer of camping tomorrow would be field day the last day of camp when their parents would come to watch their games and contests and see awards given out but for now all the cubs could think about was the big sleep-out it was just beginning to get dark when they reached skull rock grizzly bob built a campfire then he went into small cave when he came out he was dressed in a beautiful indian costume then the cubs sat in a semicircle and the powwow began bob told them old indian legends of the great animal spirits the story of the great grizzly as big as a mountain the soaring eagle who filled the sky and the mighty salmon whose colors made the rainbow as bob told the old stories the cubs could almost see the wonderful creatures in the firelit smoke as it curled up into the night sky after the powwow they had cocoa and honey bread then they curled up in their sleeping bags and soon they were all fast asleepeven sister the next day brother and sister did very well in the field day games and contests brother won a trophy for finishing second in the dash and sister got medals for the dead-bear’s float and for her bead belt it was almost the end of summer school would be starting in a couple of weeks well asked papa how did you like camp it was great said brother

rec hall  9 1984 mama’s new job  the bear family who lived in the big tree house down a sunny dirt road deep in bear country was a very happy family one of the reasons was that they were all very busy each member of the family had work to do papa bear cut and split logs and made the wood into handsome furniture which he was proud to sell mama bear not only took care of her family but she managed the whole tree house and tended the vegetable patch as well and of course brother and sister bear had important jobs too  going to school and keeping up with their schoolwork the members of the bear family had hobbies too papa’s favorite hobbies were fishing and napping he caught almost as many naps as he caught fish brother and sister also had many hobbies brother was especially proud of his model airplanes he liked to have mama watch him fly his models and sometimes she helped him fly his tether plane sister was a super rope-jumper and her goal was to jump a thousand times without a miss she liked to have mama count for her because sister could jump faster than she could count since mama was so busy with her household duties she had time for just one hobby but what a hobby mama was the best quilt maker in all of bear country her quilts were light and fluffy but very warm her stitchery was fine and even and her designs were original and exciting sister bear slept cozy and warm under a quilt that showed her jumping rope brother went to sleep under a handsome airplane design and the big quilt on mama and papa’s bed showed the bear family’s beautiful tree house yes the members of the bear family had happy busy full lives especially mama my dear called papa to mama as she worked in the vegetable patch if it wouldn’t be too much trouble would you put aside any fishing worms you might find look mama called brother i’m going to fly my new biplane i’m going to try for a thousand mama said sister would you please count for me a little too full thought mama from time to time she would have liked to have a little more time for her quilts she had some lovely design ideas she wanted to try  a sunburst with clouds and bluebirds a beautiful bouquet of flowers with butterflies and a harvest scene with pumpkins and squash but there just never seemed to be enough time then one day something happed that changed the lives of the bear family something that changed mama’s quilt-making from a hobby into a business it might not have happened except for a coincidence which is when two things happen at the same time the two things that happened were that papa had a big sale of some very special furniture and on the same day mam hung out the family quilts to air folks who came to buy papa’s handsome furniture became excited about mama’s beautiful quilts and wanted to buy them too would-be buyers offered mama quite a lot of money they were very disappointed when she told them that the quilts were not for sale with your talent you really should be in business they said mama in business said papa patting her on the shoulder i don’t think so one business-bear in the family is enough but mama wasn’t so sure she was proud of her quilt-making skills and knowledge after all she was president of the bear country quilting club other quilt makers often came to her for help and advice that evening papa and the cubs noticed that mama was very quiet she was quiet during supper she was quiet during cleanup she was quiet all evening she was quiet because she was thinking thinking about going into business the next day at lunch she made her big announcement i’ve decided to open up a quilt shop she said and i’ve rented the empty store just down the road not that overgrown wreck that’s been empty for years protested papa but you don’t want to be a business-bear said sister you’re our mama that’s no reason why i shouldn’t open my own quilt shop a lot of mama bears have jobs  mrs grizzle is a sister mrs honeybear teaches school dr gert grizzly is your pediatrician yeah said brother but they’re not our mama there’s really nothing to worry about said mama things aren’t going to be all that different will you still count for me when i jump rope asked sister and will you still watch my fly my airplanes brother wanted to know and how about my fishing worms asked papa will you still put them aside for me when you tend the vegetable patch we’ll see about all that mama said meanwhile i have to be at the shop some of my quilt club friends are helping me get it ready and oh yes she added as she turned to leave there’s a lot to do so supper may be a little late tonight ta-ta ta-ta said papa ta-ta said the cubs supper wasn’t a little late that night it was a lot late and it was papa and the cubs who prepared it but they didn’t mind because although mama was very tired she was very happy too happy and excited guess what said sister as she served mama her supper i reached a thousand jumps today brother counted for me and sis helped me fly my tether plane we had a great flight added brother and i weeded the vegetable patch said papa bringing a tub of warm water to mama for her tired feet well said mama i’m very proud of you all papa and the cubs were very proud of her too there was no way to tell whether the quilt shop would be a success but she certainly was giving it a good try after about two weeks of hard work the bear country quilt shop had its grand opening it was a very exciting event not only did mama sell her own quilts but she sold quilts for all the members of her club as well it was a great success why even mayor and mrs honeypot came in their long lavender limousine they bought one quilt and ordered three more i know what said mama as she closed ups shop that night let’s stop off at the burger bear for supper my treat the bear family celebrated with a delicious burger bear supper papa and the cubs were very proud of their business-bear wife and mama the extra money came in handy too  country quilts quilts for sale home sweet tree furniture sale furniture sale grand opening the bear country quilt shop grand opening the bear country quilt shop the burger bear  10 1985 learn about strangers  brother and sister bear who lived with their mama and papa in the big tree house down a sunny dirt road dee in bear country looked quite a lot alike except for the fact that brother was a boy cub and sister was a girl cub they were alike in many ways and even though they each had hobbies brother loved to build and fly model airplanes sister had all sorts of special interests they enjoyed many of the same things  bike riding baseball soccer frisbee and just getting out and enjoying nature yes brother and sister were alike in many ways but in some important ways they were different brother bear was cautious and careful and a little wary of strangers sister on the other hand wasn’t the least bit wary she was friendly to a fault just about every body that came her way got a big hello hello butterfly hello frog hello mr truck driver hello mrs shopper brother worried about sister’s free and easy way with strangers strangers weren’t a problem for him not talking to strangers suited cautious and careful brother just fine but friendly-to-a-fault sister was different she talked to everybody sister said brother you’re going to have to stop that stop what she asked talking to strangers it’s just not a good idea why she wanted to know why shouldn’t i talk to strangers what harm is there in it is there something wrong with strangers hmm said brother thinking about it for a moment those aren’t questions for a brother those are for a mama or papa sister bear i’m glad you asked those questions said papa bear in his deepest and most serious voice the reason you should never talk to a stranger and never ever take presents from a stranger and never ever ever go anywhere with a stranger is that it’s dangerous> what’s dangerous about it she asked wide-eyed what can happen oh dear thought mama bear i do hope papa can tell sister about strangers without making everything scary all sorts of thinks papa said here look at the newspaper as she looked at it her eyes got wider and wider this is what she saw i hope you’re paying attention to all this called papa to brother bear yes papa said brother looking up from his airplanes when sister asked for a bedtime story that evening papa said of course i have just the one it was in an old book that papa had kept since he was a cub the story was called silly goose and wily fox it told how silly goose got into a conversation with wily fox and before silly knew quite what was happening she found herself in wily’s lair this is how the story ended ’then there was a snip and a snap and all that was left of silly goose was a few floating feathers and a smile on the face of wily fox sister had a hard time falling asleep that night her mind was filled with those headline there was even one that silly goose missing wily fox questioned the sound of brother bear’s peaceful breathing finally lulled her to sleep the next day dawned bright and friendly to everybody but sister she had spend a restless night and when she looked out the window everything seemed a little strange the trees seemed to reach for her an owl stared at her and the crows glared let’s go out and ride our bikes on the village green said brother after breakfast but sister didn’t want to brother was puzzled the green was a bright busy friendly place where she loved to paly well how about some soccer but she didn’t want to do that either it wasn’t until he suggested frisbee her favorite game that she agreed to go along before they left they told mama where they’d be it was a family rule that they never went anywhere without telling mama or papa that’s fine  said mama i’m on my way to farmer ben’s for apples i’ll stop by for you on the way home the village green was the same bustling place it had always been this is what it looked like to everyone but sister this is what it looked like to her today even the frogs and butterflies seemed mean and scary to sister later when somebody tapped her on the shoulder she jumped a mile even though it was just mama how was everything at the village green asked mama on the way home in the car sister sat in front with mama and brother rode in back with the barrel of apples all right i guess said sister but there were so many strangers later at home when mama and sister were getting ready to make applesauce mama said you know what papa told you was quite right it’s not a good idea to talk to strangers or accept presents or rides from them but she continued that doesn’t mean that all strangers are bad why chances are there wasn’t a single person on that green that would harm a fly much less a fine little cub like you the trouble iswell it’s like this barrel of apples there’s an old saying that goes ‘there’ll always be a couple of bad apples in every barrel’ this the way it is with strangers cubs have to be careful because of the few bad apples look said sister i found one it’s all bumpy and has a funny shape well it certainly is strange looking said mama but that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s bad you can’t always tell from the outside which are the ‘bad apples’ she cut it in half see she said it’s fine inside now here’s on that look find on the outside  but inside ti’s all wormy yugh said sister what’s up asked brother a bad apple said sister double yugh said brother hey i’m going to the meadow to fly my new pusher plane want to come sure sister said i can pick some wildflowers she felt much better now more like her old friendly self the pusher plane was a great success and the cubs were about to head home when someone drove onto the meadow with a big beautiful orange and green model airplane wait said brother i want to watch it’s a radio-controlled job sister went back to picking wildflowers but before she knew it brother was talking to the stranger for that’s what he was a stranger no matter how big and beautiful his radio-controlled job was she dropped her wildflowers and ran over to them i’m going to send it up and follow in the car the stranger was saying want to come along wow said brother and he would have if sister hadn’t grabbed his arm and said don’t you dare the stranger drove off following his airplane and sister ran home shouting brother talked to a stranger brother talked to a stranger but it was a big orange and green radio-controlled job said brother that doesn’t matter said papa we have rules about strangers and they’re important we have rules about tattletales too said brother glaring at sister sister wasn’t tattling tattling is telling just to be mean explained mama and sister was telling because she loves you and was worried do you think that fellow was a ‘bad apple’ asked brother probably not said mama that’s right said sister most folks are friendly and nice and wouldn’t hurt a fly but you have to be careful just in case speaking of apples said mama how about some of this applesauce i just made as they sat having a dish of mama’s delicious applesauce brother and sister thought about what they had learned that day there was quite a lot to think about  hello hi hello bear country news strnger bothers cub missing cub found chief grizzlt questions stranger bear country news cub safety meeting strnger bothers cub missing cub found silly goose missing chief grizzly questions stranger willy fox questioned yipe brother and sister bear’s rules for cubs 1 never talk to a stranger 2 never take candy or other gifts from a stranger 3 never ever go anywhere with a stranger 4 don’t keep secrets from your parents especially if someone asks you to 5 your body is your own personal property and nobody else’s business especially the private parts when you’re real little of course mama or papa may help you with your bath or in the bathroom and your doctor is in the body business and will have to examine you from time to time even when you’re not little 6 use your common sense we can’t have rules for everything common sense is what keeps us safe by telling us what to do in situations that are not covered by rules  12 1986 get stage fright  on the way to school one day sister bear brother bear and cousin freddie got to talking about an important subject  their teachers teacher bob is tough but fair said freddie who was in the same class as brother brother agreed how about your teacher he asked sister is she easy or hard teacher jane isn’t easy or hard sister said she’s good then the bell rang and the cubs were ready for the school day the reason sister thought teacher jane was good was that she made things interesting when they were learning to add and subtract teacher jane set up a pretend store with play money and a toy cash register it helped the cubs learn and it was fun when the class was studying words and ideas they made posters that helped them learn too and sometimes in reading class instead of just reading from their books they acted out the stories that’s what they were doing with grizzlystiltskin the story of the funny old elf-bear who was sure that nobody could ever guess his name sister bear was acting out the part of the miller’s daughter who becomes a princess and has to spin straw into gold they had come to the part where the princess has one last change to guess the elf-bear’s name  ah good sir read sister in a loud clear voice we’ve come to the end of our guessing game because i saygrizzlystiltskin is your name that’s when grizzlystiltskin flies into a range and disappears in a puff of smoke and the princess lives happily ever after that was very good class said teacher jane so good in fact that i have a surprise for you i’m in charge of the school play this year and guess what they play is going to be grizzlystiltskin and some of you will have parts in it then she gave out the parts one of them had sister’s name on it what fun what excitement sister was going to be in the school play on the auditorium stage with scenery and costumes and makeup and everything it turned out that brother and freddie had gotten parts too brother was going to be the woodsbear who finds out the elf-bear’s name and freddie was going to play the part of grizzlystiltskin himself who are you going to be freddie asked sister when sister who hadn’t even thought to look turned to her part it said the princess wow said brother and freddie that’s the main part well how about that said papa bear when he heard the news my little princess is going to play the part of the princess say we’d better tell grizzly gramps and gran and uncle willie and aunt min calm yourself dear said mama taking papa aside sister has a lot of work ahead of her and she doesn’t need a lot of fuss and excitement hmm said papa you’re absolutely right my dear yeah why all the fuss said brother it’s just a dopey school play i already know my whole part hear me oh princess i was deep in the forest and this is what i heard  the princess’s firstborn shall be mine if she had guesses nine times nine she could not win this guessing game ‘cause grizzlystiltskin is my name see he said nothing to it but sister wasn’t so sure she was beginning to feel a little nervous about the whole thing the next day when teacher jane asked sister to take a message to the office sister decided to take a shortcut through the auditorium she had been in the auditorium many times of course but she had never been on the stage but she had never been on the stage she climbed the steps and looked out over the rows of seats it looked enormous then she imagined all the scats filled with everybody in the school and grizzly gramps and gran and uncle willie and aunt min it looked even more enormous why the long face asked brother on the way home from school sister told him she was worried about the play relax he said there’s nothing to it it’s a piece of cake why i can do my part standing on my head hanging from a branchand from inside a hollow log cousin freddie and the gang thought brother was pretty funny but sister didn’t even smile that evening sister’s worries all came out that evening sister’s worries all came out reading a part in class just isn’t the same as getting up in front of the whole school and i have to learn it all by heart she wailed how am i ever going to do it the same was you learn anything else said mama line by line page by page papa and i will help you besides you already know lots of things by heart besides you already know lots of things by heart the alphabet dozens of songs and rhymes the pledge of allegiance why i bet you know enough things by heart to fill a book you already know the story all you have to do is learn your part and practice that’s what sister did she learned her part line by line page by page and she practiced she practiced in her room in front of her toys she practiced in the field in front of her forest friends she practiced in front of mama and papa that was wonderful sweetie said papa applauding letter perfect yes sighed sister but practicing in front of my toys and forest friends and you and mama just isn’t the same as getting up on the stage in front of the whole school how do i practice for that sweetie said mama there are some things in life you can’t practice you’ve just got to do them but what if i get nervous and scared she asked oh but you will said mama i will she said of course said mama everybody gets nervous when they have to perform in front of an audience even famous opera singers and star athletes but if you know it’s natural and you expect to be a little nervous it won’t really bother you that much and you’ll do yourself proud and besides she added you’ll be having a big rehearsal in the auditorium that’ll help now where’s that brother of yours i’ve got to finish his costume i do wish he’d take this thing a little more seriously don’t worry about him mama said sister he can do his part standing on his head the rehearsal did help but an empty auditorium still wasn’t the same as a real live audience and now at last the moment had come the curtain was opening on the bear country school’s production of grizzlystiltskin and there was sister all alone on the big stage looking out at the whole school and grizzly gramps and gran and uncle willie and aunt min it waw a little scary but it was also very exciting then she heard a loud clear voice saying i am the miller’s daughter and woe is me for my father has told the king i can spin straw into gold and in truth i cannot it took her a split second to realize that the voice was hers from there on everything went beautifully there was one little rough spot near the end when it waw time for brother to do his part he came on stage in his handsome woodsbear costume looking bout at the hundreds of eyes staring at himand completely forgot what he was supposed to say i can’t remember my lines he whispered why don’t you try standing on your head whispered sister but then she took pity on him and helped him with his lines the play ended magnificently with grizzlystiltskin flying into a fury and disappearing in a puff of smoke the applause was long and loud after the show mama and papa came backstage terrific show said papa terrific congratulations said mama on a job well done a piece of cake said princess sister bear country school our store we add and subtract big bigger biggest worlds and ideas small smaller smallest sister’s part hear me oh princehear me oh princehear me oh prince princess miller’s daughter oh good sir we’ve me to the end of our guessing game because grizzystiltsskin is your name cloud spray  14 1986 the week at grandma’s  once in a while the bear family who lived in the big tree house down a sunny dirt road deep in bear country got out the family snapshots and looked at the what are these asked sister bear picking up a book of photos i don’t think i’ve ever seen these before there were pictures of bears playing tennis canoeing dancing and having all sorts of fun the bears looked like mama and papa only they were younger and thinner they’re pictures of papa and me on our honeymoon said mama with a smile at grizzly mountain lodge said papa we had a wonderful time what’s a honeymoon asked brother a honeymoon is a special trip couples take when they get married explained mama getting married is a very special happening and celebrating it with a trip is an old custom as a matter of fact said papa we’ve decided to go on a second honeymoon we’re going back to the same place and play tennis go canoeing and have fun it’ll be lovely said mama a second honeymoon sounds like a pretty good idea to me said brother me too said sister they scooted out of the room and were back in a jiffy with their vacation things oh you won’t be coming said papa honeymoons even second honeymoons are just for grownups not for cubs but but what’s going to happen to us asked sister it just so happens said mama that gran has been after me to let you spend a week with her and gramps and this will be the perfect opportunity a whole week said brother but we’ve never stayed with anybody that long said sister well said papa taking a few practice swings with his tennis racket there’s got to be a time for everything what will we do for a whole week asked the cubs where will we sleep what will we eat goodness said mama such a fuss about a simple thing like spending a week at grandma’s it didn’t seem like a simple thing to the cubs they loved gramps and gran very much butwell they just weren’t mama and papa besides gramps and gran were sort ofold what are you taking with you sister asked brother when it was time to pack i’m taking two books my jacks and my teddy of course these he said holding up some books and his best yo-yo papa put their suitcases in the car trunk last so that when they got to gran’s unloading was as easy as one-to-three then after lots of big bear hugs and kisses the happy second honeymooners were on their way it certainly is good to see young folks having fun said gan as she waved good-bye we’re the young folks muttered the cubs we’re the ones who are supposed to have fun i’m sure you’re hungry after your ride said gran when they went in how about some of y special honey nut cookies and milk no thanks gran said sister i’m not hungry right now hey these are really good said brother sister sneaked a taste they were good butwell they just weren’t mama’s now let’s get you up to your room so you can get settled said gramps the cubs reached for their bags but before you could say grizzly gramps they were gathered up bags and all and carried up the steep stairs gramps certainly was strong for someone soold the room at the top of the stairs was very nice very nice indeed butwell it just wasn’t home gramps said sister where do you suppose mama and papa are right now well said gramps i reckon they’re still on the road just pulling into sight of grizzly mountain lodge after they unpacked their things gramps thought the cubs might like to explore around the house while it wasn’t home it was an interesting house there was the attic crowded with all sorts of interesting things gran’s kitchen with its yummy tastes and smellsand gramps’ den gramps knew how to build a ship in a bottle when the cubs asked him how it was done he just smiled what do you suppose mama and papa are doing now they asked then i reckon they’ve gotten into their tennis clothes and are swatting the ball back and forth he said over the next few days brother and sister found lots to do they helped gran feed her bird friends more kinds than they had ever seen in one place and gran knew all their names they helped grams cut and smooth twigs for a new ship in a bobble it turned out that he built them outside the bottle and then slid them in it was pretty tricky they went fishing in a special place gramps knew about well said gramps as they returned with a fine catch i reckon that your mama and papa are out canoeing right now i certainly hope they’re having fun said sister because we sure are hmm better get these chairs in said gramps after a fine fish fry it’s going to rain tomorrow how do you know asked brother i can feel it in my bones answered gramps it turned out gramps was right good said brother we’ll be able to relax a little sister got out her jacks and he started to play with his yo-yo used to be pretty good with one of those myself said gramps was he ever not only could gramps make the yo-yo sleep and walk-the-dog he could even do baby-in-cradle and round-the-world that evening after a refreshing nap they all went to gramps and gran’s regular friday night square dance gramps and gran didn’t just watch they do-si-doed with the best of them they even won a prize for friskiest couple goodness said sister in the morning this week really flew by and we learned so much added brother practicing baby-in-the-cradle gramps and gran how come you know so much asked sister so many things why you can even feel the weather in your bones that’s one of the good things about being an older person said gramps smiling you learn something every day so that by the time you’re old enough to be a grandparent you know quite a lot gee said sister i guess you and gran are so old you must know everything oh no said gramps laughing you never stop learning why just this week we learned something very special we learned how absolutely wonderful it is to be grandparents and have lovely grandcubs then gramps and gran swept their grandcubs up in a big hug the next thing they knew a familiar beep beep was heard it was papa tooting the horn he and mama were back from their second honeymoon and it was time for the cubs to go home after saying good-byes and thank-yous the bear family piled into the car and headed home no sooner were they on their way than brother and sister were bubbling over with the fun and excitement of their week at grandma’s well said papa sounds like you had a pretty good time oh we did said sister papa sometime you might want to go on a third honeymoon then we could spend another week at grandma’s a third honeymoon said papa i don’t think anyone’s ever gone on a third honeymoon well said sister there has to be a first time for everything grandma’s photos photos welcome  16 1987 the bad habit sister bear who lived with her mama papa and brother in the big tree house down a sunny dirt road deep in bear country had been going to school for a quite a while first there had been nursery school which was pure fun playing with dolls and blocks rolling clay snakes and scribbling with crayons next had come kindergarten that was fun too there were marching games and rhythm band she also learned a lot of numbers in kindergarten and most of the alphabet now sister was in first grade regular school was different it was still fun and she liked teacher jane very much but it wasn’t all fun there was quite a lot of work spelling number problems all kinds of things in regular school you have to concentrate and sometimes when you concentrate you form little nervous habits that’s what happened to some of the cubs in teacher jane’s class lizzy twirled her fur twirl twirl twirl freddy scratched his head scratch scratch scratch norman sucked his thumb suck suck suck and sister nibbled her nails nibble nibble nibble nibble before she knew it she had nibbled them down to nubbins in fact she nibbled them down so far that some of her fingers were getting sore oh dear said mama bear to sister when the cubs got home from school one day you’ve nibbled your nails down to nubbins in fact you’ve nibbled them cleaned off how did it happen i’m not exactly sure mama sister said but some of them are getting sore hmm said mama well here’s what we’ll do we’ll put a little medicine on the sore ones and bits of adhesive tape on all of them that will remind you not to nibble and will give them a change to grow back the bits of tape helped sister remember not to nibble but they also got in the way when she tried to do certain things it’s very hard to hole a pencil with tape all over your fingertips or tune the tv or scratch when you have an itch but worst of all the bits of tape told the whole world that sister bear was a nail biter the next morning when sister lined up for school lizzy bruin and some others began pointing and teasing sister nibbles her nails sister nibbles her nails it didn’t take sister long to decide to pull off those bits of tape and without the tape she forgot to remember not to nibble she forgot during school she forgot on the bus she even forgot as she and brother climbed off the bus you’re going to have to cut that out sis said brother or you’ll get to e a regular full-time nail biter i’m afraid your brother’s right said mama who was organizing the wheelbarrow for some garden work i don’t mean to nag but nail biting is a very difficult habit to break habit asked sister making fists so that her nubby nibbled-off nails wouldn’t show what’s a habit that’s a good question said mama come along while i plant these tulip bulbs grizzly gran sent over and we’ll talk about it a habit mama said as she pushed the wheelbarrow along the well-worn path is something you do so often you don’t even have to think about it habits are a very important part of our lives and most of them are good like brushing your teeth and combing your fur when you get up in the morning and looking both ways before you cross a road but some habits aren’t so good like nail biting asked sister you would like to have your nice nails grow back wouldn’t you as mama’s answer oh yes said sister but i keep forgetting why is it so hard to remember well said mama it’s sort of like this path i’ve wheeled this barrow over it so many times that it’s worn a deep rut right down the middle and it keeps getting deeper every time i use it why it’s so deep now that i can’t get out of it without a little help that’s the way it is with a bad habit the more you use it the harder it is to get out of it here this is where i want to plant the bulbs what about my nail-biting habit asked sister as she helped mama out of the deep rut how am i going to get out of it you just need a little help that’s all said mama let’s plant gran’s tulips while i think about it and later i’ll talk to your papa he may have some ideas i could read the riot act to her suggested papa you know  ‘nail biting is an outrageous disgraceful habit and if you don’t stop it immediately ‘ dear me no said mama nail biting is a kind of nervous habit and shouting and threatening will just make her more nervous i suppose so said papa thoughtfully perhaps some sort of reward would help a bit of money let’s say a dime for every day she doesn’t bite her nails before mama could answer sister bear who had been nervously nibbling in the next room popped in and said a dime ten whole cents every day just for not biting my nails that’s right said papa until the habit’s broken i’ll never nibble again she said as she thought of all those lovely dimes she was going to get but the way it turned out she didn’t get a single dime all she got was discouraged a day is a long time and habits are powerful especially bad habits even with the promise of a dime sister couldn’t remember not to nibble mama and papa got discouraged too oh well sighed mama life goes on i must call gran and thank her for the tulip bulbs oh you’re very welcome my dear said gran when mama called and how is everything at your house is that soyou know i was a nail biter when i was a cub and my mama helped me to stop what have you tried so far um uh-huh well i think you’re on the right track with the dime but instead of a dime and instead of giving it to her at the end of the day what an interesting idea said mama as she listened to wise old grizzly gran so they tried gran’s idea instead of a dime at the end of each day they gave sister ten pennies one for each nail at the beginning of each day ten pennies to keep unless she nibbled and with those pennies in her pocket jiggling when she got on the school bus jingling when she jumped rope in the schoolyardjust waiting to be remembered when some nail decided it needed a nibblethe plan worked not perfectly it’s hard to break a habit and sister had to give back some of those pennies but in ten days she had ninety-three pennies but even better  she had ten fine fingernails great for picking things up turning the tv and scratching itches and the next time she played jacks she got all the way to tensies phew said papa bear i’m glad that’s over yes indeed agreed mama breathing a great sigh of relief that’s when brother bear looked at his fingernails and piped up you know i think i might start biting my nails i could use the money i certainly hope you’re joking roared papa because if you’re not  i’m joking i’m joking interrupted brother  and he was sort of 11111 2222 3333 4444 aa aa bb bb cccc hat bat cat ball tall wall up/down big/small

one day sneezing and wheezing mama bear knew just what to do she took his temperature tucked him into bed and went right to the phone and called dr grizzly sneezing and wheezing and a temperature of a hundred and one said dr grizzly keep him in bed give him plenty of liquids and keep him home from school until his temperature is back to normal mama followed the doctor’s orders and little by little brother’s temperature began to go down i feel a little better he said may i get out of bed i’m afraid not said mama the doctor wants you to stay in bed but there’s no reason why your stay shouldn’t be as pleasant as possiblepapa she called would you bring up the portable tv the portable had remote control and pretty soon brother was having a fine time switching from one cartoon show to another when he tired of tv he got out his comic books and when he tired of those mama brought him his dinosaur collection there was no doubt about it except for his sniffles brother bear was having a pretty good time so when sister bear brought home a folder of schoolwork for him he hardly looked at it he was much too busy having fun but while he was at home having fun his fellow students at school were hard at work in the classroom where teacher bob was teaching a new math lesson they had learned to add subtract and multiply now they were learning to divide on the soccer field where coach bruin was getting the team ready for the big game against beartown cousin freddy he called take brother’s place at forward he’s out sick yes sir said freddy this was the chance he’d been waiting for  it wasn’t until brother was all better and ready to go back to school that he remembered the folder of work oh well he thought i’ll study it on the bus but that’s where he heard about freddy and the soccer team he was so upset he forgot all about studying when coach bruin had extra practice during early gym brother became even more upset it wasn’t easy watching freddy take his place on the team then when brother got back to class teacher bob said i certainly hope you studied that work folder because we’re going to have a quiz a quiz said brother on what on division of course said teacher bob as he handed out the quiz papers brother might have managed even then he was good with numbers and might have worked things out if only he’d been able to concentrate but all he could think about was cousin freddy out there kicking field goals while he sat on the bench the quiz was a disaster not only did brother get every problem wrong but teacher bob wrote on the paper  very poor must be signed by parent brother didn’t know which was worse  the soccer mess or the quiz disaster what would he say to mama and papa when they asked him how things had gone at school he was so busy feeling sorry for himself on the bus ride home that he didn’t notice that sister was coming down with a bad case of the sneezes and wheezes oh dear said mama when she saw sister you’ve caught brother’s cold into bed with you she and papa were so busy attending to sister that they forgot to ask brother how things went at schooland he didn’t tell them and the next morning when the school bus came brother didn’t get on the bus he hid in the tall grass until the bus was out of sight the squirrels and bluebirds were puzzled brother was usually happy and cheerful but not this morning this morning he looked unhappy and angry too phooey brother shouted kicking a stone but kicking the stone reminded him of soccer and that just made him angrier the bluebirds took off and the squirrels scattered phooey on soccer he shouted stomping off through the woods stomp stomp stomp grasshoppers hopped toads stood stock-still and pretended they were bumps on a log phooey on school brother shouted stomping out of the woods pansies hid their faces ladybugs flew away home  and he said reaching into his schoolbag phooey on division he had come to the top of a big hill he took out the quiz folded it into a paper airplane and sailed it high into the air the hill overlooked a swampy overgrown bog as brother watched the quiz circle and swoop he noticed something out of the corner of his eye a familiar house at the edge of the bog grizzly gramps was working on a ship model when he heard the knock gran was making cookies they weren’t expecting visitors and they certainly weren’t expecting brother especially during school hours it didn’t take long for the whole story to come out gramps and gran listened quietly as brother told them about catching cold the folder of work the soccer mess the quiz disaster the missed bus and the paper airplane come with me young feller said gramps i want to show you something gramps took brother by the hand and led him deep into the bog there he said that’s what i want to show you it was a very old wagon sunk almost out of sight in a muddy pond how did it get there asked brother it wasn’t easy said gramps i went to a lot of trouble getting that old wagon into this swamp then with a twinkle in his eye he said just the way you did getting in over your head at school it happed a long time ago when i took a wrong turn just the way you did when you didn’t study that schoolwork that teacher bob sent home well instead of admitting my mistake and backing up i just pushed ahead until i was in so deep there was no getting out and you lost the wagon said brother yep said gramps but i learned a valuable lesson if you find yourself on the wrong road don’t just keep on going until you’re in over your head back up and start over on the right road how am i going to do that asked brother oh i think we can manage but first look over there gramps said pointing there it was  the paper airplane caught in a berry bush what do you think they’ll say asked brother later as they bounced along in gramps’s pickup  we’ll find out soon enough said gramps pulling to a stop in front of the big tree house and let’s not forget gran’s bag of cookies they’re her finest mama and papa weren’t exactly pleased when they heard about the big mess brother had gotten himself into but they didn’t holler and pound the table either not even papa he looked like he might be going to when he saw the paper he had to sign gramps had tried to flatten it out but it was still pretty wrinkled what happened to this he asked oh said gramps it just sort of got folded a bit that’s when he brought out gran’s cookies there were ten of them let’s see now he said there are five of us counting sister so how many cookies do we each get two of course said brother dividing them up don’t look now young feller said gramps with a wink but you just divided then by five is that all there is to dividing said brother that’s all said gramps come along said mama in a no-nonsense voice where are we going asked brother to school mama said as they got in the car but it’s so late protested brother it’s never too late to correct a mistake mama said and off they went brother got to class just in time for a retest the class hadn’t done very well on the division quiz so teacher bob was giving them a second chance brother really concentrated and did much better and that afternoon he got a second chance at soccer too it was the day of the big game against beartown and things weren’t going very well brother said coach bruin i want you to go in for freddy i don’t think he’s quite ready for first team glad to help coach brother said as he ran out onto the field you know what they say it’s never too late to correct a mistake ah-choo diploma dr gert grizzly soccer is how i get my kicks soccer is
