"It was a notice telling about an important meeting that night at the Bear Country Town Hall. \What's this?\"" said Papa Bear, as he took the day's mail from the Bear Family's mailbox. It was a notice telling about an important meeting that night at the Bear Country Town Hall. Mama Bear called up Grizzly Gran. Brother and Sister Bear sometimes stayed with Gramps and Gran when Mama and Papa Bear had to be away. But Gramps and Gran were planning to go to the meeting too. So Brother and Sister couldn't stay with them. Or with Aunt Maude... or Cousin Wilbur. They were going to the meeting, too. \""Why can't we go with you?\"" asked Sister, beginning to get a little upset. \""Yeah!\"" added Brother Bear. \""Because,\"" said Papa, \""this meeting is for grown-ups. And besides, it won't be over until late—way past your bedtime.\"" \""Well, where are we going to stay?\"" the cubs wanted to know. \""You're going to stay right here, said Mama, as she put down the phone. \""Alone?\"" asked Sister. \""Of course not,\"" said Mama. \""I've arranged for a sitter.\"" \""A sitter?!\"" said Brother. \""Who is it going to be?\"" Sister asked. \""Mrs. Grizzle, who lives in the hollow stump at the end of the road,\"" said Mama, feeling much better about the whole thing. \""Mrs. Grizzle!\"" said the cubs, not feeling better at all... Once, when Sister was playing with her friend, their ball went into Mrs. Grizzle's flower garden. Mrs. Grizzle wasn't too happy about it. And another time, when Brother was flying his kite, it swooped and bumped Mrs. Grizzle on the hat. She wasn't too tickled about that, either. Later that evening, after the supper things has been cleaned up, Mama and Papa got ready to go to the town meeting. \""But who's going to scrub our backs, read us a story, and tuck us in?\"" asked Sister, still a little nervous about the idea of a sitter. \""I understand that Mrs. Grizzle has raised seven cubs of her own,\"" said Mama, putting on her hat. \""And I'm sure she's a perfectly good back scrubber, story reader, and tucker-inner.\"" \""She's not going to scrub my back!\"" Brother Bear said under his breath. Mrs. Grizzle came walking up the path to the Bear's tree house right on time. There was no question about it. It was the same Mrs. Grizzle who got bopped with the kite and didn't like cubs tromping her flowers. She was very large—almost as big as Papa—and she carried a drawstring bag. \""Evening', all!\"" said Mrs. Grizzle in a loud, jolly voice. \""Well, time's a-wastin' you two!\"" she said to Mama and Papa. \""You better skedaddle off to your meetin'!\"" Mrs. Grizzle had a strong way of saying things, and folks usually did what she said. Mama and Papa kissed the cubs good night—and skedaddled. \""Whew!\"" said Mrs. Grizzle, as she sat down in Papa's big chair. \""It sure is good to get a load off your feet!\"" She took off her hat and looked into her drawstring bag. There's something about somebody looking into a bag that makes cubs very curious. \""Mrs. Grizzle?\"" said Sister. \""Yes?\"" \""What's in the bag?\"" \""Nothin' much. Just somethings I take along when I go sittin'—a piece of string, a pack of cards...\"" Meanwhile, over at the Town Hall, the bears were getting ready for their important meeting. They were getting ready for speeches, voting and arguments about some new laws. But Mama's mind was not on the meeting. Neither was Papa's. Mama and Papa Bear were thinking about what was going on back home. \""Sister looked a little worried when we left,\"" fretted Mama. \""So did Brother,\"" agreed Papa. They decided to call home and see how things were going. \""Things are goin' just fine,\"" said Mrs. Grizzle. \""Brother and Sister can't come to the phone right now. They're busy playin' Cat's Cradle...\"" \""Have a good meeting!\"" shouted the cubs. \""—But they say to have a good meeting!\"" After Cat's Cradle, they played Go Fish with the cards that came out of Mrs. Grizzle's drawstring bag. Then they played Tiddly-winks with a special set of winks that Mrs. Grizzle had made out of polished stones and a snail-shell cup. After a while, the cubs got the yawns, and Mrs. Grizzle began getting them ready for bed. And she did, indeed, turn out to be a very good back scrubber (Brother changed his mind about not having his back scrubbed)... And she was a find story reader... and a really super tucker-inner. \""I hope Mama and Papa had a good meeting,\"" said Sister with a yawn, \""because we had a very good sit.\"" The cubs had a number of different sitters from time to time, but Mrs. Grizzle was their favorite—and they were always glad to see her.""",1981,sitter,social 
"It was the last day of school and the beginning of vacation—that wonderful time when little bears could sit around doing absolutely nothing. Brother Bear and Sister Bear shouted good-bye to Teacher Jane and hopped onto the bus for the happy trip home. \Well?\"" asked Mama Bear after a day or so of vacation. \""Are you enjoying sitting around doing nothing?\"" \""It's great!\"" said Sister. \""Absolutely!\"" said Brother. \""There's just one trouble with it,\"" added Sister. \""There's nothing to do!\"" \""Here's take a look at this,\"" said Mama as she reached for something that had come in the mail. This is what it looked like: Some of the things looked interesting. But Brother wondered what \""fully supervised\"" meant. And Sister wasn't so sure about that \""overnight sleep-out.\"" It sounded a little scary. \""Where is this camp?\"" asked Sister. \""Not far,\"" answered Mama. \""How will we get there?\"" Brother wanted to know. \""A bus comes for you in the morning and brings you home in the afternoon.\"" \""Sounds a little like school,\"" said Brother. \""We'll think about it,\"" said the cubs, and went back to doing nothing—well, not exactly nothing...They picked a few wildflowers. turned over a few rocks...chased a few butterflies,—and thought about it. \""Mama, could we try Grizzly Bob's Day Camp just to see if we like it?\"" they asked. \""Of course,\"" said Mama. A couple of mornings later, Brother and Sister were in camp shorts and T-shirts, all ready and waiting when the bus came. It didn't look much like the school bus. And Grizzly Bob didn't look much like Teacher Jane. And the camp didn't look anything like school! Grizzly Bob had built his camp beside a lake at the edge of the forest. There were log buildings, a flagpole flying the camp flag, a big bulletin board with the camp rules—there certainly were a lot of rules—some interesting paths, a roped-in place to swim...There was even a big red canoe! Bob had made name tags for the cubs. \""You're campmates now, so you better get to know each other,\"" he said. Then he took them on a tour of the camp. There was an office with a desk, where he did his paperwork, and first-aid corner full of bandages and things for cubs and cruises. There was a Rec Hall to go into when it rained. \""Rec\"" was short for recreation. There was a picnic place and a barbecue pit where they roasted hot dogs for lunch. Sister burned hers a little, but she traded with another cub who liked burned hot dogs. Bob announced that after lunch they would all climb up Spook Hill to the very top of Skull Rock—the special place where they would have their end-of-camp powwow and sleep-out. It was quite a climb! That evening Mama and Papa Bear were eager to know how the cubs liked camp. \""It was okay,\"" said Brother. \""But they sure have a lot of rules!\"" \""It was all right,\"" agreed Sister. \""They sure have plenty of bandages and stingy stuff for cuts!\"" But what they were both thinking about was skull Rock and that end-of-camp sleep-out. Especially Sister. The second day was different. Brother had a great day. He passed the swimming test and was allowed to ride in the canoe. Sister didn't have such a good day. She played dodge ball ad some of the cubs threw pretty hard. The third day Sister had fun. She got a star for a birch picture frame she made in arts and crafts. But Brother hurt his knee in the wheelbarrow race. The fourth day both of them had fun. And every day after that! So much fun that they forgot about Skull Rock and the sleep-out... —almost. Papa found the sleeping bags that he and Mama had used on their honeymoon, and when the camp bus came on the morning of the big night, Brother and Sister were ready...sort of. The climb up Spooky Hill wasn't so hard this time—even with backpacks. The cubs were strong and tough from their summer of camping. Tomorrow would be Field Day—the last day of camp, when their parents would come to watch their games and contests and see awards given out. But, for now, all the cubs could think about was the big sleep-out. It was just beginning to get dark when they reached Skull Rock. Grizzly Bob built a campfire. Then he went into small cave. When he came out, he was dressed in a beautiful Indian costume! Then the cubs sat in a semicircle, and the powwow began. Bob told them old Indian legends of the great animal spirits—the story of the Great Grizzly as Big as a Mountain, the Soaring Eagle Who Filled the Sky, and the Mighty Salmon Whose Colors Made the Rainbow. As Bob told the old stories, the cubs could almost see the wonderful creatures in the firelit smoke as it curled up into the night sky. After the powwow, they had cocoa and honey bread. Then they curled up in their sleeping bags. And soon they were all fast asleep...even Sister. The next day Brother and Sister did very well in the Field Day games and contests. Brother won a trophy for finishing second in the dash, and Sister got medals for the dead-bear's float and for her bead belt. It was almost the end of summer, school would be starting in a couple of weeks. \""Well?\"" asked Papa. \""How did you like camp?\"" \""It was great!\"" said Brother, hugging his trophy. \""It was great!\"" agreed Sister, wearing her medals proudly. \""But you know something? After Grizzly Bob's Day Camp, school will be like a vacation!\""""",1982,go to camp,social  
"The Bear family, who lived in the big tree house down a sunny dirt road deep in Bear Country, was a very happy family. One of the reasons was that they were all very busy. Each member of the family had work to do. Papa Bear cut and split logs and made the wood into handsome furniture which he was proud to sell. Mama Bear not only took care of her family, but she managed the whole tree house and tended the vegetable patch as well. And, of course, Brother and Sister Bear had important jobs too: going to school and keeping up with their schoolwork. The members of the Bear family had hobbies, too. Papa's favorite hobbies were fishing and napping. He caught almost as many naps as he caught fish. Brother and Sister also had many hobbies. Brother was especially proud of his model airplanes. He liked to have Mama watch him fly his models, and sometimes she helped him fly his tether plane. Sister was a super rope-jumper and her goal was to jump a thousand times without a miss. She liked to have Mama count for her because Sister could jump faster than she could count. Since Mama was so busy with her household duties, she had time for just one hobby—but what a hobby! Mama was the best quilt maker in all of Bear Country! Her quilts were light and fluffy, but very warm. Her stitchery was fine and even. And her designs were original and exciting. Sister Bear slept cozy and warm under a quilt that showed her jumping rope. Brother went to sleep under a handsome airplane design. And the big quilt on Mama and Papa's bed showed the Bear family's beautiful tree house. Yes, the members of the Bear family had happy, busy, full lives. Especially Mama. \My dear,\"" called Papa to Mama as she worked in the vegetable patch, \""if it wouldn't be too much trouble, would you put aside any fishing worms you might find?\"" \""Look, Mama!\"" called Brother. \""I'm going to fly my new biplane!\"" \""I'm going to try for a thousand, Mama!\"" said Sister. \""Would you please count for me?\"" A little too full, thought Mama from time to time. She would have liked to have a little more time for her quilts. She had some lovely design ideas she wanted to try: a sunburst with clouds and bluebirds... a beautiful bouquet of flowers with butterflies... and a harvest scene with pumpkins and squash. But there just never seemed to be enough time. Then one day something happed that changed the lives of the Bear family—something that changed Mama's quilt-making from a hobby... into a business! It might not have happened except for a coincidence, which is when two things happen at the same time. The two things that happened were that Papa had a big sale of some very special furniture, and on the same day Mam hung out the family quilts to air. Folks who came to buy Papa's handsome furniture became excited about Mama's beautiful quilts and wanted to buy them, too. Would-be buyers offered Mama quite a lot of money. They were very disappointed when she told them that the quilts were not for sale. \""With your talent, you really should be in business!\"" they said. \""Mama in business?\"" said Papa, patting her on the shoulder. \""I don't think so. One business-bear in the family is enough.\"" But Mama wasn't so sure. She was proud of her quilt-making skills and knowledge. After all, she was president of the Bear Country Quilting Club. Other quilt makers often came to her for help and advice. That evening Papa and the cubs noticed that Mama was very quiet. She was quiet during supper. She was quiet during cleanup. She was quiet all evening. She was quiet because she was thinking—thinking about going into business. The next day at lunch she made her big announcement. \""I've decided to open up a quilt shop.\"" she said, \""and I've rented the empty store just down the road.\"" \""Not that overgrown wreck that's been empty for years!\"" protested Papa. \""But you don't want to be a business-bear,\"" said Sister. \""you're our mama!\"" \""That's no reason why I shouldn't open my own quilt shop. A lot of mama bears have jobs: Mrs. Grizzle is a sister; Mrs. Honeybear teaches school; Dr. Gert grizzly is your pediatrician...\"" \""Yeah,\"" said Brother, \""but they're not our mama!\"" \""There's really nothing to worry about,\"" said Mama. \""Things aren't going to be all that different.\"" \""Will you still count for me when I jump rope?\"" asked Sister. \""And will you still watch my fly my airplanes?\"" Brother wanted to know. \""And how about my fishing worms?\"" asked Papa. \""Will you still put them aside for me when you tend the vegetable patch?\"" \""We'll see about all that,\"" Mama said. \""Meanwhile, I have to be at the shop. Some of my quilt club friends are helping me get it ready—and, oh yes,\"" she added as she turned to leave, \""there's a lot to do, so supper may be a little late tonight. Ta-ta!\"" \""Ta-ta!\"" said Papa. \""Ta-ta!\"" said the cubs. Supper wasn't a little late that night. It was a lot late—and it was Papa and the cubs who prepared it. But they didn't mind, because although Mama was very tired, she was very happy, too—happy and excited! \""Guess what!\"" said Sister as she served Mama her supper. \""I reached a thousand jumps today! Brother counted for me!\"" \""And Sis helped me fly my tether plane! We had a great flight!\"" added Brother. \""And I weeded the vegetable patch,\"" said Papa, bringing a tub of warm water to Mama for her tired feet. \""Well,\"" said Mama. \""I'm very proud of you all.\"" Papa and the cubs were very proud of her, too. There was no way to tell whether the quilt shop would be a success, but she certainly was giving it a good try. After about two weeks of hard work, the Bear Country Quilt Shop had its grand opening. It was a very exciting event! Not only did Mama sell her own quilts, but she sold quilts for all the members of her club as well. It was a great success. Why, even Mayor and Mrs. Honeypot came in their long lavender limousine. They bought one quilt and ordered three more. \""I know what!\"" said Mama as she closed ups shop that night. \""Let's stop off at the Burger Bear for supper! My treat!\"" The Bear family celebrated with a delicious Burger Bear supper. Papa and the cubs were very proud of their business-bear wife and mama. The extra money came in handy too!""",1984,mama's new job,social   
"Brother and Sister Bear, who lived with their mama and papa in the big tree house down a sunny dirt road dee in Bear Country, looked quite a lot alike. Except for the fact that Brother was a boy cub and Sister was a girl cub, they were alike in many ways. And even though they each had hobbies (Brother loved to build and fly model airplanes; Sister had all sorts of special interests), they enjoyed many of the same things: bike riding, baseball, soccer, Frisbee, and just getting out and enjoying nature. Yes, Brother and Sister were alike in many ways. But in some important ways they were different. Brother Bear was cautious and careful and a little wary of strangers, Sister, on the other hand, wasn't the least bit wary. She was friendly to a fault. Just about every body that came her way got a big hello. \Hello, butterfly!\"" \""Hello, frog!\"" \""Hello, Mr. Truck Driver!\"" \""Hello, Mrs. Shopper!\"" Brother worried about Sister's free and easy way with strangers. Strangers weren't a problem for him. Not talking to strangers suited cautious and careful Brother just fine. But friendly-to-a-fault Sister was different. She talked to everybody. \""Sister,\"" said Brother. \""You're going to have to stop that!\"" \""Stop what?\"" she asked. \""Talking to strangers! It's just not a good idea!\"" \""Why?\"" she wanted to know. \""Why shouldn't I talk to strangers? What harm is there in it? Is there something wrong with strangers?\"" \""Hmm,\"" said Brother, thinking about it for a moment. \""Those aren't questions for a brother. Those are for a mama or papa...\"" \""Sister Bear, I'm glad you asked those questions!\"" said Papa Bear, in his deepest and most serious voice. \""The reason you should never talk to a stranger and never ever take presents from a stranger and never ever ever go anywhere with a stranger is that it's dangerous>\"" \""What's dangerous about it?\"" she asked, wide-eyed. \""What can happen?\"" \""Oh, dear,\"" thought Mama Bear. \""I do hope Papa can tell Sister about strangers without making everything scary.\"" \""All sorts of thinks!\"" Papa said. \""Here! Look at the newspaper!\"" As she looked at it her eyes got wider and wider. This is what she saw... \""I hope you're paying attention to all this,\"" called Papa to Brother Bear. \""Yes, Papa,\"" said Brother looking up from his airplanes. When Sister asked for a bedtime story that evening, Papa said, \""Of course! I have just the one!\"" It was in an old book that Papa had kept since he was a cub. The story was called \""Silly Goose and Wily Fox.\"" It told how Silly Goose got into a conversation with Wily Fox, and before Silly knew quite what was happening she found herself in Wily's lair. This is how the story ended. \""'...then there was a snip and a snap and all that was left of Silly Goose was a few floating feathers and a smile on the face of Wily Fox.\"" Sister had a hard time falling asleep that night. Her mind was filled with those headline. There was even one that SILLY GOOSE MISSING! WILY FOX QUESTIONED! The sound of Brother Bear's peaceful breathing finally lulled her to sleep. The next day dawned bright and friendly—to everybody but Sister. She had spent a restless night and when she looked out the window, everything seemed a little strange. The trees seemed to reach for her, an owl stared at her, and the crows glared. \""Let's go out and ride our bikes on the village green!\"" said Brother after breakfast. But Sister didn't want to. Brother was puzzled. The green was a bright, busy, friendly place where she loved to play. \""Well, how about some soccer?\"" But she didn't want to do that either. It wasn't until he suggested Frisbee, her favorite game, that she agreed to go along. Before they left, they told Mama where they'd be—it was a family rule that they never went anywhere without telling Mama or Papa. \""That's fine,\"" said Mama. \""I'm on my way to Farmer Ben's for apples. I'll stop by for you on the way home.\"" The village green was the same bustling place it had always been. This is what it looked like—to everyone but Sister. This is what it looked like to her. Today even the frogs and butterflies seemed mean and scary to Sister. Later, when somebody tapped her on the shoulder, she jumped a mile—even though it was just Mama. \""How was everything at the village green?\"" asked Mama on the way home in the car. Sister sat in front with mama, and Brother rode in back with the barrel of apples. \""All right, I guess,\"" said Sister. \""But there were so many strangers!\"" Later at home, when Mama and Sister were getting ready to make applesauce, Mama said, \""You know, what Papa told you was quite right. \""it's not a good idea to talk to strangers or accept presents or rides from them. \""But,\"" she continued, \""that doesn't mean that all strangers are bad. Why, chances are, there wasn't a single person on that green that would harm a fly, much less a fine little cub like you. The trouble is...well, it's like this barrel of apples. There's an old saying that goes, ‘There'll always be a couple of bad apples in every barrel.' This the way it is with strangers. Cubs have to be careful because of the few bad apples. \""Look! said Sister. \""I found one! It's all bumpy and has a funny shape!\"" \""Well, it certainly is strange looking,\"" said Mama. \""But that doesn't necessarily mean it's bad. You can't always tell from the outside which are the ‘bad apples.'\"" She cut it in half. \""See?\"" she said. \""It's fine inside.\"" \""Now here's on that look find on the outside...—but inside, it's all wormy.\"" \""Yugh!\"" said Sister. \""What's up?\"" asked Brother. \""A bad apple!\"" said Sister. \""Double yugh!\"" said Brother. \""Hey! I'm going to the meadow to fly my new pusher plane. Want to come?\"" \""Sure,\"" Sister said. \""I can pick some wildflowers!\"" She felt much better now—more like her old friendly self. The pusher plane was a great success, and the cubs were about to head home when someone drove onto the meadow with a big beautiful orange and green model airplane. \""Wait!\"" said Brother. \""I want to watch! It's a radio-controlled job!\"" Sister went back to picking wildflowers, but before she knew it, Brother was talking to the stranger! For that's what he was, a stranger—no matter how big and beautiful his radio-controlled job was! She dropped her wildflowers and ran over to them. \""I'm going to send it up and follow in the car,\"" the stranger was saying. \""Want to come along?\"" \""Wow! said Brother. And he would have—if Sister hadn't grabbed his arm and said, \""Don't you dare!\"" The stranger drove off following his airplane, and Sister ran home shouting. \""Brother talked to a stranger! Brother talked to a stranger!\"" \""But it was a big orange and green radio-controlled job! said Brother. \""That doesn't matter,\"" said Papa. \""We have rules about strangers—and they're important!\"" \""We have rules about tattletales, too,\"" said Brother, glaring at Sister. \""Sister wasn't tattling. Tattling is telling just to be mean,\"" explained Mama. \""And Sister was telling because she loves you and was worried.\"" \""Do you think that fellow was a ‘bad apple'?\"" asked Brother. \""Probably not,\"" said Mama. \""That's right,\"" said Sister. \""Most folks are friendly and nice and wouldn't hurt a fly. But you have to be careful, just in case.\"" \""Speaking of apples,\"" said Mama, \""how about some of this applesauce I just made?\"" As they sat having a dish of Mama's delicious applesauce, Brother and Sister thought about what they had learned that day. There was quite a lot to think about. 1. Never talk to a stranger. 2. Never take candy or other gifts from a stranger. 3. Never ever go anywhere with a stranger. 4. Don't keep secrets from your parents—especially if someone asks you to. 5. Your body is your own personal property and nobody else's business—especially the private parts. (When you're real little, of course, mama or Papa may help you with your bath or in the bathroom—and your doctor is in the body business and will have to examine you from time to time, even when you're not little.) 6. Use your common sense. We can't have rules for everything. Common sense is what keeps us safe by telling us what to do in situations that are not covered by rules.""",1985,learn about strangers,social   
"On the way to school one day Sister Bear, Brother Bear, and Cousin Freddie got to talking about an important subject: their teachers. \Teacher Bob is tough but fair,\"" said Freddie, who was in the same class as Brother. Brother agreed. \""How about your teacher?\"" he asked Sister. \""Is she easy or hard?\"" \""Teacher Jane isn't easy or hard,\"" Sister Said. \""She's good.\"" Then the bell rang and the cubs were ready for the school day. The reason Sister thought Teacher Jane was good was that she made things interesting. When they were learning to add and subtract, Teacher jane set up a pretend store with play money and a toy cash register. It helped the cubs learn, and it was fun. When the class was studying words and ideas, they made posters. That helped them learn too. And sometimes in reading class, instead of just reading from their books, they acted out the stories. That's what they were doing with Grizzlystiltskin, the story of the funny old elf-bear who was sure that nobody could ever guess his name. Sister Bear was acting out the part of the miller's daughter who becomes a princess and has to spin straw into gold. They had come to the part where the princess has one last change to guess the elf-bear's name: \""Ah, good sir,\"" read Sister in a loud, clear voice. \""We've come to the end of our guessing game, because I say...Grizzlystiltskin is your name!\"" That's when Grizzlystiltskin flies into a range and disappears in a puff of smoke—and the princess lives happily ever after. \""That was very good, class,\"" said Teacher Jane. \""So good, in fact, that I have a surprise for you. I'm in charge of the school play this year, and guess what—they play is going to be Grizzlystiltskin, and some of you will have parts in it!\"" Then she gave out the parts. One of them had Sister's name on it. What fun! What excitement! Sister was going to be in the school play on the auditorium stage with scenery and costumes and makeup and everything. It turned out that Brother and Freddie had gotten parts too. Brother was going to be the woodsbear who finds out the elf-bear's name, and Freddie was going to play the part of Grizzlystiltskin himself. \""Who are you going to be?\"" Freddie asked Sister. When Sister, who hadn't even thought to look, turned to her part, it said THE PRINCESS. \""Wow!\"" said Brother and Freddie. \""That's the main part!\"" \""Well, how about that!\"" said Papa Bear when he heard the news. \""My little princess is going to play the part of the princess! Say, we'd better tell Grizzly Gramps and Gran! And Uncle Willie and Aunt Min!\"" \""Calm yourself, dear!\"" said Mama, taking Papa aside. \""Sister has a lot of work ahead of her and she doesn't need a lot of fuss and excitement.\"" \""Hmm,\"" said Papa. \""You're absolutely right, my dear.\"" \""Yeah, why all the fuss?\"" said Brother. \""It's just a dopey school play. I already know my whole part... \""Hear me, oh, Princess! I was deep in the forest and this is what I heard: The princess's firstborn shall be mine! If she had guesses nine times nine, she could not win this guessing game, ‘cause Grizzlystiltskin is my name!\"" \""See?\"" he said. \""Nothing to it!\"" But Sister wasn't so sure. She was beginning to feel a little nervous about the whole thing. The next day, when Teacher Jane asked Sister to take a message to the office, Sister decided to take a shortcut through the auditorium. She had been in the auditorium many times, of course, but she had never been on the stage, but she had never been on the stage. She climbed the steps and looked out over the rows of seats. It looked enormous. Then she imagined all the scats filled with everybody in the school and Grizzly Gramps and Gran and Uncle Willie and Aunt Min. It looked even more enormous. \""Why the long face?\"" asked Brother on the way home from school. Sister told him she was worried about the play. \""Relax,\"" he said. \""There's nothing to it. It's a piece of cake. \""Why, I can do my part standing on my head...\"" \""...hanging from a branch...and from inside a hollow log!\"" Cousin Freddie and the gang thought Brother was pretty funny. But Sister didn't even smile. That evening Sister's worries all came out. That evening Sister's worries all came out. \""Reading a part in class just isn't the same as getting up in front of the whole school! And I have to learn it all by heart!\"" she wailed. \""How am I ever going to do it?\"" \""The same was you learn anything else,\"" said Mama. \""Line by line, page by page. Papa and I will help you. \""Besides, you already know lots of things by heart. Besides, you already know lots of things by heart—the alphabet, dozens of songs and rhymes, the Pledge of Allegiance. Why, I bet you know enough things by heart to fill a book.\"" \""You already know the story. All you have to do is learn your part and practice.\"" That's what Sister did. She learned her part line by line, page by page. And she practiced. She practiced in her room in front of her toys. She practiced in the field in front of her forest friends. She practiced in front of Mama and Papa. \""That was wonderful, Sweetie!\"" said Papa, applauding. \""Letter perfect!\"" \""Yes,\"" sighed Sister, \""but practicing in front of my toys and forest friends and you and Mama just isn't the same as getting up on the stage in front of the whole school. How do I practice for that?\"" \""Sweetie,\"" said Mama, \""there are some things in life you can't practice—you've just got to do them.\"" \""But what if I get nervous and scared?\"" she asked. \""Oh, but you will,\"" said Mama. \""I will?\"" she said. \""Of course! said Mama. \""Everybody gets nervous when they have to perform in front of an audience—even famous opera singers and star athletes. But if you know it's natural and you expect to be a little nervous, it won't really bother you that much—and you'll do yourself proud! \""And besides,\"" she added, \""you'll be having a big rehearsal in the auditorium. That'll help. Now where's that brother of yours? I've got to finish his costume. I do wish he'd take this thing a little more seriously.\"" \""Don't worry about him, Mama,\"" said Sister. \""He can do his part standing on his head.\"" The rehearsal did help, but an empty auditorium still wasn't the same as a real live audience. And now, at last, the moment had come! The curtain was opening on the Bear country School's production of Grizzlystiltskin! And there was Sister all alone on the big stage looking out at the whole school and Grizzly Gramps and Gran and Uncle Willie and Aunt Min. It was a little scary. But it was also very exciting. Then she heard a loud, clear voice saying, \""I am the miller's daughter and woe is me, for my father has told the king I can spin straw into gold and, in truth, I cannot!\"" It took her a split second to realize that the voice was hers! From there on everything went beautifully. There was one little rough spot near the end when it was time for Brother to do his part. He came on stage in his handsome woodsbear costume, looking bout at the hundreds of eyes staring at him...and completely forgot what he was supposed to say! \""I can't remember my lines! he whispered. \""Why don't you try standing on your head?\"" whispered Sister. But then she took pity on him and helped him with his lines. The play ended magnificently with Grizzlystiltskin flying into a fury and disappearing in a puff of smoke. The applause was long and loud.

"Once in a while the Bear family, who lived in the big tree house down a sunny dirt road deep in Bear Country, got out the family snapshots and looked at them. \What are these?\"" asked Sister Bear, picking up a book of photos. \""I don't think I've ever seen these before.\"" There were pictures of bears playing tennis, canoeing, dancing, and having all sorts of fun. The bears looked like Mama and Papa, only they were younger and thinner. \""They're pictures of Papa and me on our honeymoon,\"" said Mama with a smile. \""At Grizzly Mountain Lodge,\"" said Papa. \""We had a wonderful time!\"" \""What's a honeymoon?\"" asked Brother. \""A honeymoon is a special trip couples take when they get married,\"" explained Mama. \""Getting married is a very special happening and celebrating it with a trip is an old custom.\"" \""As a matter of fact\"" said Papa, \""we've decided to go on a second honeymoon. We're going back to the same place and play tennis, go canoeing, and have fun!\"" \""It'll be lovely,\"" said Mama. \""A second honeymoon sounds like a pretty good idea to me,\"" said Brother. \""Me, too,\"" said Sister. They scooted out of the room and were back in a jiffy with their vacation things. \""Oh, you won't be coming,\"" said Papa. \""Honeymoons, even second honeymoons, are just for grownups, not for cubs.\"" \""But... but what's going to happen to us?\"" asked Sister. \""It just so happens,\"" said Mama, \""that Gran has been after me to let you spend a week with her and Gramps. And this will be the perfect opportunity.\"" \""A whole week?\"" said Brother. \""But we've never stayed with anybody that long! said Sister. \""Well,\"" said Papa, taking a few practice swings with his tennis racket, \""there's got to be a time for everything.\"" \""What will we do for a whole week?\"" asked the cubs. \""Where will we sleep? What will we eat?\"" \""Goodness!\"" said Mama. \""Such a fuss about a simple thing like spending a week at Grandma's.\"" It didn't seem like a simple thing to the cubs. They loved Gramps and Gran very much, but... well, they just weren't Mama and Papa. Besides, Gramps and Gran were sort of...old. \""What are you taking with you?\"" Sister asked Brother when it was time to pack. \""I'm taking two books, my jacks, and my teddy, of course.\"" \""These,\"" he said, holding up some books and his best yo-yo. Papa put their suitcases in the car trunk last so that when they got to Gran's, unloading was as easy as one-to-three. Then, after lots of big bear hugs and kisses, the happy second honeymooners were on their way. \""It certainly is good to see young folks having fun,\"" said Gan as she waved good-bye. \""We're the young folks,\"" muttered the cubs. \""We're the ones who are supposed to have fun.\"" \""I'm sure you're hungry after your ride,\"" said Gran when they went in. \""How about some of y special honey nut cookies and milk?\"" \""No thanks, Gran,\"" said Sister. \""I'm not hungry right now.\"" \""Hey, these are really good,\"" said Brother. Sister sneaked a taste. They were good, but... well, they just weren't Mama's. \""Now let's get you up to your room so you can get settled,\"" said Gramps. The cubs reached for their bags, but before you could say \""Grizzly Gramps,\"" they were gathered up, bags and all, and carried up the steep stairs. Gramps certainly was strong for someone so...old. The room at the top of the stairs was very nice—very nice, indeed, but... well, it just wasn't home. \""Gramps,\"" said Sister, \""where do you suppose Mama and Papa are right now?\"" \""Well,\"" said Gramps, \""I reckon they're still on the road, just pulling into sight of Grizzly Mountain Lodge.\"" After they unpacked their things, Gramps thought the cubs might like to explore around the house. While it wasn't home, it was an interesting house. There was the attic crowded with all sorts of interesting things... Gran's kitchen with its yummy tastes and smells... and Gramps' den. Gramps knew how to build a ship in a bottle. When the cubs asked him how it was done, he just smiled. \""What do you suppose Mama and Papa are doing now?\"" they asked then. \""I reckon they've gotten into their tennis clothes and are swatting the ball back and forth,\"" he said. Over the next few days Brother and Sister found lots to do. They helped Gran feed her bird friends—more kinds than they had ever seen in one place. And Gran knew all their names. They helped Grams cut and smooth twigs for a new ship in a bobble. It turned out that he built them outside the bottle and then slid them in. It was pretty tricky. They went fishing in a special place Gramps knew about. \""Well,\"" said Gramps as they returned with a fine catch, \""I reckon that your mama and papa are out canoeing right now.\"" \""I certainly hope they're having fun!\"" said Sister. \""Because we sure are!\"" \""Hmm. Better get these chairs in,\"" said Gramps after a fine fish fry. \""It's going to rain tomorrow.\"" \""How do you know?\"" asked Brother. \""I can feel it in my bones,\"" answered Gramps. It turned out Gramps was right. \""Good,\"" said Brother. \""We'll be able to relax a little.\"" Sister got out her jacks and he started to play with his yo-yo. \""Used to be pretty good with one of those myself,\"" said Gramps. Was he ever! Not only could Gramps make the yo-yo sleep and walk-the-dog, he could even do baby-in-cradle and round-the-world! That evening, after a refreshing nap, they all went to Gramps and Gran's regular Friday night square dance. Gramps and Gran didn't just watch. They do-si-doed with the best of them. They even won a prize—for Friskiest Couple. \""Goodness!\"" said Sister in the morning. \""This week really flew by!\"" \""And we learned so much,\"" added Brother, practicing baby-in-the-cradle. \""Gramps and Gran, how come you know so much?\"" asked Sister. \""So many things! Why, you can even feel the weather in your bones!\"" \""That's one of the good things about being an older person,\"" said Gramps, smiling. \""You learn something every day. So that by the time you're old enough to be a grandparent, you know quite a lot. \""Gee,\"" said Sister, \""I guess you and Gran are so old you must know everything!\"" \""Oh, no,\"" said Gramps, laughing. \""You never stop learning. Why, just this week we learned something very special. We learned how absolutely wonderful it is to be grandparents and have lovely grandcubs.\"" Then Gramps and Gran swept their grandcubs up in a big hug. The next thing they knew, a familiar beep! beep! was heard. It was Papa tooting the horn. He and Mama were back from their second honeymoon and it was time for the cubs to go home. After saying good-byes and thank-yous, the Bear family piled into the car and headed home. No sooner were they on their way than Brother and Sister were bubbling over with the fun and excitement of their week at Grandma's. \""Well,\"" said Papa, \""sounds like you had a pretty good time.\"" \""Oh, we did!\"" said Sister. \""Papa, sometime you might want to go on a third honeymoon. Then we could spend another week at Grandma's. \""A third honeymoon?\"" said Papa. \""I don't think anyone's ever gone on a third honeymoon.\"" \""Well,\"" said Sister, \""there has to be a first time for everything!\""""",1986,the week at grandma's,social
"Sister Bear, who lived with her mama, papa, and brother in the big tree house down a sunny dirt road deep in Bear Country, had been going to school for a quite a while. First there had been nursery school, which was pure fun—playing with dolls and blocks, rolling clay snakes, and scribbling with crayons. Next had come kindergarten. That was fun too. There were marching games and rhythm band. She also learned a lot of numbers in kindergarten—and most of the alphabet. Now Sister was in first grade. Regular school was different. It was still fun and she liked Teacher Jane very much, but it wasn't all fun. There was quite a lot of work—spelling, number problems, all kinds of things. In regular school you have to concentrate—and sometimes when you concentrate, you form little nervous habits. That's what happened to some of the cubs in Teacher Jane's class. Lizzy twirled her fur. Twirl, twirl, twirl. Freddy scratched his head. Scratch, scratch, scratch. Norman sucked his thumb. Suck, suck, suck. And Sister nibbled her nails. Nibble, nibble, nibble, nibble. Before she knew it, she had nibbled them down to nubbins. In fact, she nibbled them down so far that some of her fingers were getting sore. \Oh, dear!\"" said Mama Bear to Sister when the cubs got home from school one day. \""You've nibbled your nails down to nubbins. In fact, you've nibbled them cleaned off. How did it happen?\"" \""I'm not exactly sure, Mama,\"" Sister said. \""But some of them are getting sore.\"" \""Hmm,\"" said Mama. \""Well, here's what we'll do. We'll put a little medicine on the sore ones and bits of adhesive tape on all of them. That will remind you not to nibble and will give them a change to grow back\"" The bits of tape helped Sister remember not to nibble, but they also got in the way when she tried to do certain things. It's very hard to hole a pencil with tape all over your fingertips, or tune the TV, or scratch when you have an itch. But worst of all, the bits of tape told the whole world that Sister Bear was a nail biter. The next morning, when sister lined up for school, Lizzy Bruin and some others began pointing and teasing. \""Sister nibbles her nails! Sister nibbles her nails!\"" It didn't take Sister long to decide to pull off those bits of tape! And without the tape, she forgot to remember not to nibble. She forgot during school. She forgot on the bus. She even forgot as she and Brother climbed off the bus. \""You're going to have to cut that out, Sis,\"" said Brother, \""or you'll get to be a regular full-time nail biter.\"" \""I'm afraid your brother's right,\"" said Mama, who was organizing the wheelbarrow for some garden work. \""I don't mean to nag, but nail biting is a very difficult habit to break.\"" \""Habit?\"" asked Sister, making fists so that her nubby, nibbled-off nails wouldn't show. \""What's a habit?\"" \""That's a good question,\"" said Mama. \""Come along while I plant these tulip bulbs Grizzly Gran sent over and we'll talk about it. \""A habit,\"" Mama said as she pushed the wheelbarrow along the well-worn path, \""is something you do so often you don't even have to think about it. Habits are a very important part of our lives. And most of them are good—like brushing your teeth and combing your fur when you get up in the morning, and looking both ways before you cross a road. But some habits aren't so good.\"" \""Like nail biting?\"" asked Sister. \""You would like to have your nice nails grow back, wouldn't you?\"" as Mama's answer. \""Oh, yes!\"" said Sister. \""But I keep forgetting! Why is it so hard to remember?\"" \""Well,\"" said Mama, \""it's sort of like this path. I've wheeled this barrow over it so many times that it's worn a deep rut right down the middle. And it keeps getting deeper every time I use it. Why, it's so deep now that I can't get out of it without a little help.\"" \""That's the way it is with a bad habit—the more you use it, the harder it is to get out of it. Here, this is where I want to plant the bulbs.\"" \""What about my nail-biting habit?\"" asked Sister as she helped Mama out of the deep rut. \""How am I going to get out of it?\"" \""You just need a little help, that's all,\"" said Mama. \""Let's land Gran's tulips while I think about it. And later I'll talk to your papa. He may have some ideas.\"" \""I could read the riot act to her,\"" suggested Papa. \""You know: ‘Nail biting is an outrageous, disgraceful habit and if you don't stop it immediately—‘\"" \""Dear me, no!\"" said Mama. \""Nail biting is a kind of nervous habit, and shouting and threatening will just make her more nervous.\"" \""I suppose so,\"" said Papa thoughtfully. \""Perhaps some sort of reward would help. A bit of money—Let's say a dime for every day she doesn't bite her nails.\"" Before Mama could answer, Sister Bear, who had been nervously nibbling in the next room, popped in and said, \""A dime—ten whole cents every day just for not biting my nails?\"" \""That's right,\"" said Papa. \""Until the habit's broken.\"" \""I'll never nibble again!\"" she said as she thought of all those lovely dimes she was going to get. But the way it turned out, she didn't get a single dime. All she got was discouraged. A day is a long time and habits are powerful—especially bad habits. Even with the promise of a dime, Sister couldn't remember not to nibble. Mama and Papa got discouraged too. \""Oh, well,\"" sighed Mama. \""Life goes on. I must call Gran and thank her for the tulip bulbs.\"" \""Oh, you're very welcome, my dear,\"" said Gran when Mama called. \""And how is everything at your house?...Is that so?...You know, I was a nail biter when I was a cub and my mama helped me to stop. What have you tried so far?... Um...Uh-huh...Well, I think you're on the right track with the dime, but instead of a dime, and instead of giving it to her at the end of the day...\"" \""What an interesting idea,\"" said Mama as she listened to wise old Grizzly Gran. So they tried Gran's idea. Instead of a dime at the end of each day, they gave Sister ten pennies—one for each nail—at the beginning of each day. Ten pennies to keep—unless she nibbled. And with those pennies in her pocket, jiggling when she got on the school bus, jingling when she jumped rope in the schoolyard...just waiting to be remembered when some nail decided it needed a nibble... the plan worked! Not perfectly. It's hard to break a habit, and Sister had to give back some of those pennies. But in ten days she had ninety-three pennies! But even better: she had ten fine fingernails. Great for picking things up, turning the TV, and scratching itches. And the next time she played jacks she got all the way to tensies! \""Phew!\"" said Papa Bear. \""I'm glad that's over.\"" \""Yes, indeed!\"" agreed Mama, breathing a great sigh of relief. That's when Brother Bear looked at his fingernails and piped up, \""You know, I think I might start biting my nails—I could use the money.\"" \""I certainly hope you're joking!\"" roared Papa. \""Because if you're not—\"" \""I'm joking. I'm joking,\"" interrupted Brother.  And he was—sort of.""",1987,the bad habit,social
"Though Brother and Sister Bear were usually very healthy, they occasionally caught cold. So when Brother came home from school one day sneezing and wheezing. Mama Bear knew just what to do. She took his temperature, tucked him into bed, and went right to the phone and called Dr. Grizzly. \Sneezing and wheezing and a temperature of a hundred and one?\"" said Dr. Grizzly. \""Keep him in bed, give him plenty of liquids, and keep him home from school until his temperature is back to normal.\"" Mama followed the doctor's orders, and little by little Brother's temperature began to go down. \""I feel a little better,\"" he said. \""May I get out of bed?\"" \""I'm afraid not,\"" said Mama. \""The doctor wants you to stay in bed.\"" \""But there's no reason why your stay shouldn't be as pleasant as possible... Papa!\"" she called. \""Would you bring up the portable TV?\"" The portable had remote control, and pretty soon Brother was having a fine time switching from one cartoon show to another. When he tired of TV he got out his comic books, and when he tired of those, Mama brought him his dinosaur collection. There was no doubt about it—except for his sniffles, Brother Bear was having a pretty good time. So when Sister Bear brought home a folder of schoolwork for him, he hardly looked at it—he was much too busy having fun. But while he was at home having fun, his fellow students at school were hard at work... In the classroom, where Teacher Bob was teaching a new math lesson. They had learned to add, subtract, and multiply. Now they were learning to divide. On the soccer field, where Coach Bruin was getting the team ready for the big game against Beartown... \""Cousin Freddy!\"" he called. \""Take Brother's place at forward. He's out sick.\"" \""Yes, sir!\"" said Freddy. This was the chance he'd been waiting for.  It wasn't until Brother was all better and ready to go back to school that he remembered the folder of work. \""Oh well,\"" he thought, \""I'll study it on the bus.\"" But that's where he heard about Freddy and the soccer team. He was so upset he forgot all about studying. When Coach Bruin had extra practice during early gym, Brother became even more upset. It wasn't easy watching Freddy take his place on the team. Then, when Brother got back to class, Teacher Bob said, \""I certainly hope you studied that work folder, because we're going to have a quiz.\"" \""A quiz?\"" said Brother. \""On what?\"" \""On division, of course,\"" said Teacher Bob as he handed out the quiz papers. Brother might have managed even then. He was good with numbers and might have worked things out if only he'd been able to concentrate. But all he could think about was Cousin Freddy out there kicking field goals while he sat on the bench. The quiz was a disaster. Not only did Brother get every problem wrong, but Teacher Bob wrote on the paper: \""Very poor! Must be signed by parent.\"" Brother didn't know which was worse: the soccer mess or the quiz disaster. What would he say to Mama and Papa when they asked him how things had gone at school? He was so busy feeling sorry for himself on the bus ride home that he didn't notice that Sister was coming down with a bad case of the sneezes and wheezes. \""Oh, dear!\"" said Mama when she saw Sister. \""You've caught Brother's cold. Into bed with you!\"" She and Papa were so busy attending to Sister that they forgot to ask Brother how things went at school...and he didn't tell them! And the next morning, when the school bus came, Brother didn't get on the bus! He hid in the tall grass until the bus was out of sight. The squirrels and bluebirds were puzzled—Brother was usually happy and cheerful. But not this morning. This morning he looked unhappy—and angry, too. \""Phooey!\"" Brother shouted, kicking a stone. But kicking the stone reminded him of soccer and that just made him angrier. The bluebirds took off and the squirrels scattered. \""Phooey on soccer!\"" he shouted, stomping off through the woods. Stomp! Stomp! Stomp! Grasshoppers hopped. Toads stood stock-still and pretended they were bumps on a log. \""Phooey on school!\"" Brother shouted, stomping out of the woods. Pansies hid their faces. Ladybugs flew away home.  \""And,\"" he said, reaching into his schoolbag, \""phooey on division!\"" He had come to the top of a big hill. He took out the quiz, folded it into a paper airplane, and sailed it high into the air. The hill overlooked a swampy, overgrown bog. As Brother watched the quiz circle and swoop he noticed something out of the corner of his eye—a familiar house at the edge of the bog. Grizzly Gramps was working on a ship model when he heard the knock. Gran was making cookies. They weren't expecting visitors and they certainly weren't expecting Brother—especially during school hours. It didn't take long for the whole story to come out. Gramps and Gran listened quietly as Brother told them about catching cold, the folder of work, the soccer mess, the quiz disaster, the missed bus, and the paper airplane. \""Come with me, young feller,\"" said Gramps. \""I want to show you something.\"" Gramps took Brother by the hand and led him deep into the bog. \""There!\"" he said. \""That's what I want to show you.\"" It was a very old wagon sunk almost out of sight in a muddy pond. \""How did it get there?\"" asked Brother. \""It wasn't easy,\"" said Gramps. \""I went to a lot of trouble getting that old wagon into this swamp.\"" Then, with a twinkle in his eye, he said, \""Just the way you did getting in over your head at school! \""It happed a long time ago when I took a wrong turn—just the way you did when you didn't study that schoolwork that Teacher Bob sent home. Well, instead of admitting my mistake and backing up, I just pushed ahead until I was in so deep there was no getting out.\"" \""And you lost the wagon,\"" said Brother. \""Yep,\"" said Gramps. \""But I learned a valuable lesson. If you find yourself on the wrong road, don't just keep on going until you're in over your head—back up and start over on the right road.\"" \""How am I going to do that?\"" asked Brother. \""Oh, I think we can manage—but first, look over there,\"" Gramps said, pointing. There it was: the paper airplane—caught in a berry bush. \""What do you think they'll say?\"" asked Brother later as they bounced along in Gramps's pickup.  \""We'll find out soon enough,\"" said Gramps, pulling to a stop in front of the big tree house. \""And let's not forget Gran's bag of cookies. They're her finest.\"" Mama and Papa weren't exactly pleased when they heard about the big mess Brother had gotten himself into. But they didn't holler and pound the table, either—not even Papa. He looked like he might be going to when he saw the paper he had to sign—Gramps had tried to flatten it out but it was still pretty wrinkled. \""What happened to this? he asked. \""Oh,\"" said Gramps. \""It just sort of got folded a bit.\"" That's when he brought out Gran's cookies. There were ten of them. \""Let's see, now,\"" he said, \""there are five of us counting Sister. So how many cookies do we each get?\"" \""Two, of course,\"" said Brother, dividing them up. \""Don't look now, young feller,\"" said Gramps with a wink, \""but you just divided then by five!\"" \""Is that all there is to dividing?\"" said Brother. \""That's all,\"" said Gramps. \""Come along,\"" said Mama in a no-nonsense voice. \""Where are we going?\"" asked Brother. \""To school,\"" Mama said as they got in the car. \""But it's so late,\"" protested Brother. \""It's never too late to correct a mistake,\"" Mama said, and off they went. Brother got to class just in time for a retest. The class hadn't done very well on the division quiz, so Teacher Bob was giving them a second chance. Brother really concentrated and did much better. And that afternoon he got a second chance at soccer, too. It was the day of the big game against Beartown and things weren't going very well. \""Brother,\"" said Coach Bruin, \""I want you to go in for Freddy. I don't think he's quite ready for first team.\"" \""Glad to help, Coach,\"" Brother said as he ran out onto the field. \""You know what they say—it's never too late to correct a mistake.\""""",1987,the trouble at school,social
