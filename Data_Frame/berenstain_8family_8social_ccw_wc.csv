it was the last day of school and the beginning of vacation that wonderful time when little bears could sit around doing absolutely nothing brother bear and sister bear shouted good-bye to teacher jane and hopped onto the bus for the happy trip home well asked mama bear after a day or so of vacation are you enjoying sitting around doing nothing it’s great said sister absolutely said brother there’s just one trouble with it added sister there’s nothing to do here’s take a look at this said mama as she reached for something that had come in the mail this is what it looked like  some of the things looked interesting but brother wondered what fully supervised meant and sister wasn’t so sure about that overnight sleep-out it sounded a little scary where is this camp asked sister not far answered mama how will we get there brother wanted to know a bus comes for you in the morning and brings you home in the afternoon sounds a little like school said brother we’ll think about it said the cubs and went back to doing nothing well not exactly nothing they picked a few wildflowers turned over a few rocks chased a few butterflies and thought about it mama could we try grizzly bob’s day camp just to see if we like it they asked of course said mama a couple of mornings later brother and sister were in camp shorts and t-shirts all ready and waiting when the bus came it didn’t look much like the school bus and grizzly bob didn’t look much like teacher jane and the camp didn’t look anything like school grizzly bob had built his camp beside a lake at the edge of the forest there were log buildings a flagpole flying the camp flag a big bulletin board with the camp rules there certainly were a lot of rules some interesting paths a roped-in place to swim there was even a big red canoe bob had made name tags for the cubs you’re campmates now so you better get to know each other he said then he took them on a tour of the camp there was an office with a desk where he did his paperwork and first-aid corner full of bandages and things for cubs and cruises there was a rec hall to go into when it rained rec was short for recreation there was a picnic place and a barbecue pit where they roasted hot dogs for lunch sister burned hers a little but she traded with another cub who liked burned hot dogs bob announced that after lunch they would all climb up spook hill to the very top of skull rock the special place where they would have their end-of-camp powwow and sleep-out it was quite a climb that evening mama and papa bear were eager to know how the cubs liked camp it was okay said brother but they sure have a lot of rules it was all right agreed sister they sure have plenty of bandages and stingy stuff for cuts but what they were both thinking about was skull rock and that end-of-camp sleep-out especially sister the second day was different brother had a great day he passed the swimming test and was allowed to ride in the canoe sister didn’t have such a good day she played dodge ball ad some of the cubs threw pretty hard the third day sister had fun she got a star for a birch picture frame she made in arts and crafts but brother hurt his knee in the wheelbarrow race the fourth day both of them had fun and every day after that so much fun that they forgot about skull rock and the sleep-out  almost papa found the sleeping bags that he and mama had used on their honeymoon and when the camp bus came on the morning of the big night brother and sister were ready sort of the climb up spooky hill wasn’t so hard this time even with backpacks the cubs were strong and tough from their summer of camping tomorrow would be field day the last day of camp when their parents would come to watch their games and contests and see awards given out but for now all the cubs could think about was the big sleep-out it was just beginning to get dark when they reached skull rock grizzly bob built a campfire then he went into small cave when he came out he was dressed in a beautiful indian costume then the cubs sat in a semicircle and the powwow began bob told them old indian legends of the great animal spirits the story of the great grizzly as big as a mountain the soaring eagle who filled the sky and the mighty salmon whose colors made the rainbow as bob told the old stories the cubs could almost see the wonderful creatures in the firelit smoke as it curled up into the night sky after the powwow they had cocoa and honey bread then they curled up in their sleeping bags and soon they were all fast asleep even sister the next day brother and sister did very well in the field day games and contests brother won a trophy for finishing second in the dash and sister got medals for the dead-bear’s float and for her bead belt it was almost the end of summer school would be starting in a couple of weeks well asked papa how did you like camp it was great said brother hugging his trophy it was great agreed sister wearing her medals proudly but

the bear family who lived in the big tree house down a sunny dirt road deep in bear country was a very happy family one of the reasons was that they were all very busy each member of the family had work to do papa bear cut and split logs and made the wood into handsome furniture which he was proud to sell mama bear not only took care of her family but she managed the whole tree house and tended the vegetable patch as well and of course brother and sister bear had important jobs too  going to school and keeping up with their schoolwork the members of the bear family had hobbies too papa’s favorite hobbies were fishing and napping he caught almost as many naps as he caught fish brother and sister also had many hobbies brother was especially proud of his model airplanes he liked to have mama watch him fly his models and sometimes she helped him fly his tether plane sister was a super rope-jumper and her goal was to jump a thousand times without a miss she liked to have mama count for her because sister could jump faster than she could count since mama was so busy with her household duties she had time for just one hobby but what a hobby mama was the best quilt maker in all of bear country her quilts were light and fluffy but very warm her stitchery was fine and even and her designs were original and exciting sister bear slept cozy and warm under a quilt that showed her jumping rope brother went to sleep under a handsome airplane design and the big quilt on mama and papa’s bed showed the bear family’s beautiful tree house yes the members of the bear family had happy busy full lives especially mama my dear called papa to mama as she worked in the vegetable patch if it wouldn’t be too much trouble would you put aside any fishing worms you might find look mama called brother i’m going to fly my new biplane i’m going to try for a thousand mama said sister would you please count for me a little too full thought mama from time to time she would have liked to have a little more time for her quilts she had some lovely design ideas she wanted to try  a sunburst with clouds and bluebirds a beautiful bouquet of flowers with butterflies and a harvest scene with pumpkins and squash but there just never seemed to be enough time then one day something happed that changed the lives of the bear family something that changed mama’s quilt-making from a hobby into a business it might not have happened except for a coincidence which is when two things happen at the same time the two things that happened were that papa had a big sale of some very special furniture and on the same day mama hung out the family quilts to air folks who came to buy papa’s handsome furniture became excited about mama’s beautiful quilts and wanted to buy them too would-be buyers offered mama quite a lot of money they were very disappointed when she told them that the quilts were not for sale with your talent you really should be in business they said mama in business said papa patting her on the shoulder i don’t think so one business-bear in the family is enough but mama wasn’t so sure she was proud of her quilt-making skills and knowledge after all she was president of the bear country quilting club other quilt makers often came to her for help and advice that evening papa and the cubs noticed that mama was very quiet she was quiet during supper she was quiet during cleanup she was quiet all evening she was quiet because she was thinking thinking about going into business the next day at lunch she made her big announcement i’ve decided to open up a quilt shop she said and i’ve rented the empty store just down the road not that overgrown wreck that’s been empty for years protested papa but you don’t want to be a business-bear said sister you’re our mama that’s no reason why i shouldn’t open my own quilt shop a lot of mama bears have jobs  mrs grizzle is a sister mrs honeybear teaches school dr gert grizzly is your pediatrician yeah said brother but they’re not our mama there’s really nothing to worry about said mama things aren’t going to be all that different will you still count for me when i jump rope asked sister and will you still watch my fly my airplanes brother wanted to know and how about my fishing worms asked papa will you still put them aside for me when you tend the vegetable patch we’ll see about all that mama said meanwhile i have to be at the shop some of my quilt club friends are helping me get it ready and oh yes she added as she turned to leave there’s a lot to do so supper may be a little late tonight ta-ta ta-ta said papa ta-ta said the cubs supper wasn’t a little late that night it was a lot late and it was papa and the cubs who prepared it but they didn’t mind because although mama was very tired she was very happy too happy and excited guess what said sister as she served mama her supper i reached a thousand jumps today brother counted for me and sis helped me fly my tether plane we had a great flight added brother and i weeded the vegetable patch said papa bringing a tub of warm water to mama for her tired feet well said mama i’m very proud of you all papa and the cubs were very proud of her too there was no way to tell whether the quilt shop would be a success but she certainly was giving it a good try after about two weeks of hard work the bear country quilt shop had its grand opening it was a very exciting event not only did mama sell her own quilts but she sold quilts for all the members of her club as well it was a great success why even mayor and mrs honeypot came in their long lavender limousine they bought one quilt and ordered three more i know what said mama as she closed ups shop that night let’s stop off at the burger bear for supper my treat the bear family celebrated with a delicious burger bear supper papa and the cubs were very proud of their business-bear wife and mama the extra money came in handy too  country quilts quilts for sale home sweet tree

brother and sister bear who lived with their mama and papa in the big tree house down a sunny dirt road dee in bear country looked quite a lot alike except for the fact that brother was a boy cub and sister was a girl cub they were alike in many ways and even though they each had hobbies brother loved to build and fly model airplanes sister had all sorts of special interests they enjoyed many of the same things  bike riding baseball soccer frisbee and just getting out and enjoying nature yes brother and sister were alike in many ways but in some important ways they were different brother bear was cautious and careful and a little wary of strangers sister on the other hand wasn’t the least bit wary she was friendly to a fault just about every body that came her way got a big hello hello butterfly hello frog hello mr truck driver hello mrs shopper brother worried about sister’s free and easy way with strangers strangers weren’t a problem for him not talking to strangers suited cautious and careful brother just fine but friendly-to-a-fault sister was different she talked to everybody sister said brother you’re going to have to stop that stop what she asked talking to strangers it’s just not a good idea why she wanted to know why shouldn’t i talk to strangers what harm is there in it is there something wrong with strangers hmm said brother thinking about it for a moment those aren’t questions for a brother those are for a mama or papa sister bear i’m glad you asked those questions said papa bear in his deepest and most serious voice the reason you should never talk to a stranger and never ever take presents from a stranger and never ever ever go anywhere with a stranger is that it’s dangerous> what’s dangerous about it she asked wide-eyed what can happen oh dear thought mama bear i do hope papa can tell sister about strangers without making everything scary all sorts of thinks papa said here look at the newspaper as she looked at it her eyes got wider and wider this is what she saw i hope you’re paying attention to all this called papa to brother bear yes papa said brother looking up from his airplanes when sister asked for a bedtime story that evening papa said of course i have just the one it was in an old book that papa had kept since he was a cub the story was called silly goose and wily fox it told how silly goose got into a conversation with wily fox and before silly knew quite what was happening she found herself in wily’s lair this is how the story ended ’then there was a snip and a snap and all that was left of silly goose was a few floating feathers and a smile on the face of wily fox sister had a hard time falling asleep that night her mind was filled with those headline there was even one that silly goose missing wily fox questioned the sound of brother bear’s peaceful breathing finally lulled her to sleep the next day dawned bright and friendly to everybody but sister she had spent a restless night and when she looked out the window everything seemed a little strange the trees seemed to reach for her an owl stared at her and the crows glared let’s go out and ride our bikes on the village green said brother after breakfast but sister didn’t want to brother was puzzled the green was a bright busy friendly place where she loved to play well how about some soccer but she didn’t want to do that either it wasn’t until he suggested frisbee her favorite game that she agreed to go along before they left they told mama where they’d be it was a family rule that they never went anywhere without telling mama or papa that’s fine said mama i’m on my way to farmer ben’s for apples i’ll stop by for you on the way home the village green was the same bustling place it had always been this is what it looked like to everyone but sister this is what it looked like to her today even the frogs and butterflies seemed mean and scary to sister later when somebody tapped her on the shoulder she jumped a mile even though it was just mama how was everything at the village green asked mama on the way home in the car sister sat in front with mama and brother rode in back with the barrel of apples all right i guess said sister but there were so many strangers later at home when mama and sister were getting ready to make applesauce mama said you know what papa told you was quite right it’s not a good idea to talk to strangers or accept presents or rides from them but she continued that doesn’t mean that all strangers are bad why chances are there wasn’t a single person on that green that would harm a fly much less a fine little cub like you the trouble is well it’s like this barrel of apples there’s an old saying that goes ‘there’ll always be a couple of bad apples in every barrel’ this the way it is with strangers cubs have to be careful because of the few bad apples look said sister i found one it’s all bumpy and has a funny shape well it certainly is strange looking said mama but that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s bad you can’t always tell from the outside which are the ‘bad apples’ she cut it in half see she said it’s fine inside now here’s on that look find on the outside but inside it’s all wormy yugh said sister what’s up asked brother a bad apple said sister double yugh said brother hey i’m going to the meadow to fly my new pusher plane want to come sure sister said i can pick some wildflowers she felt much better now more like her old friendly self the pusher plane was a great success and the cubs were about to head home when someone drove onto the meadow with a big beautiful orange and green model airplane wait said brother i want to watch it’s a radio-controlled job sister went back to picking wildflowers but before she knew it brother was talking to the stranger for that’s what he was a stranger no matter how big and beautiful his radio-controlled job was she dropped her wildflowers and ran over to them i’m going to send it up and follow in the car the stranger was saying want to come along wow said brother and he would have if sister hadn’t grabbed his arm and said don’t you dare the stranger drove off following his airplane and sister ran home shouting brother talked to a stranger brother talked to a stranger but it was a big orange and green radio-controlled job said brother that doesn’t matter said papa we have rules about strangers and they’re important we have rules about tattletales too said brother glaring at sister sister wasn’t tattling tattling is telling just to be mean explained mama and sister was telling because she loves you and was worried do you think that fellow was a ‘bad apple’ asked brother probably not said mama that’s right said sister most folks are friendly and nice and wouldn’t hurt a fly but you have to be careful just in case speaking of apples said mama how about some of this applesauce i just made as they sat having a dish of mama’s delicious applesauce brother and sister thought about what they had learned that day there was quite a lot to think about  hello hi hello bear country news stranger bothers cub missing cub found chief grizzly questions stranger bear country news cub safety meeting stranger bothers cub missing cub found silly goose missing chief grizzly questions stranger willy fox questioned yipe brother and sister bear’s rules for cubs 1 never

on the way to school one day sister bear brother bear and cousin freddie got to talking about an important subject  their teachers teacher bob is tough but fair said freddie who was in the same class as brother brother agreed how about your teacher he asked sister is she easy or hard teacher jane isn’t easy or hard sister said she’s good then the bell rang and the cubs were ready for the school day the reason sister thought teacher jane was good was that she made things interesting when they were learning to add and subtract teacher jane set up a pretend store with play money and a toy cash register it helped the cubs learn and it was fun when the class was studying words and ideas they made posters that helped them learn too and sometimes in reading class instead of just reading from their books they acted out the stories that’s what they were doing with grizzlystiltskin the story of the funny old elf-bear who was sure that nobody could ever guess his name sister bear was acting out the part of the miller’s daughter who becomes a princess and has to spin straw into gold they had come to the part where the princess has one last change to guess the elf-bear’s name  ah good sir read sister in a loud clear voice we’ve come to the end of our guessing game because i say grizzlystiltskin is your name that’s when grizzlystiltskin flies into a range and disappears in a puff of smoke and the princess lives happily ever after that was very good class said teacher jane so good in fact that i have a surprise for you i’m in charge of the school play this year and guess what they play is going to be grizzlystiltskin and some of you will have parts in it then she gave out the parts one of them had sister’s name on it what fun what excitement sister was going to be in the school play on the auditorium stage with scenery and costumes and makeup and everything it turned out that brother and freddie had gotten parts too brother was going to be the woodsbear who finds out the elf-bear’s name and freddie was going to play the part of grizzlystiltskin himself who are you going to be freddie asked sister when sister who hadn’t even thought to look turned to her part it said the princess wow said brother and freddie that’s the main part well how about that said papa bear when he heard the news my little princess is going to play the part of the princess say we’d better tell grizzly gramps and gran and uncle willie and aunt min calm yourself dear said mama taking papa aside sister has a lot of work ahead of her and she doesn’t need a lot of fuss and excitement hmm said papa you’re absolutely right my dear yeah why all the fuss said brother it’s just a dopey school play i already know my whole part hear me oh princess i was deep in the forest and this is what i heard  the princess’s firstborn shall be mine if she had guesses nine times nine she could not win this guessing game ‘cause grizzlystiltskin is my name see he said nothing to it but sister wasn’t so sure she was beginning to feel a little nervous about the whole thing the next day when teacher jane asked sister to take a message to the office sister decided to take a shortcut through the auditorium she had been in the auditorium many times of course but she had never been on the stage but she had never been on the stage she climbed the steps and looked out over the rows of seats it looked enormous then she imagined all the scats filled with everybody in the school and grizzly gramps and gran and uncle willie and aunt min it looked even more enormous why the long face asked brother on the way home from school sister told him she was worried about the play relax he said there’s nothing to it it’s a piece of cake why i can do my part standing on my head hanging from a branch and from inside a hollow log cousin freddie and the gang thought brother was pretty funny but sister didn’t even smile that evening sister’s worries all came out that evening sister’s worries all came out reading a part in class just isn’t the same as getting up in front of the whole school and i have to learn it all by heart she wailed how am i ever going to do it the same was you learn anything else said mama line by line page by page papa and i will help you besides you already know lots of things by heart besides you already know lots of things by heart the alphabet dozens of songs and rhymes the pledge of allegiance why i bet you know enough things by heart to fill a book you already know the story all you have to do is learn your part and practice that’s what sister did she learned her part line by line page by page and she practiced she practiced in her room in front of her toys she practiced in the field in front of her forest friends she practiced in front of mama and papa that was wonderful sweetie said papa applauding letter perfect yes sighed sister but practicing in front of my toys and forest friends and you and mama just isn’t the same as getting up on the stage in front of the whole school how do i practice for that sweetie said mama there are some things in life you can’t practice you’ve just got to do them but what if i get nervous and scared she asked oh but you will said mama i will she said of course said mama everybody gets nervous when they have to perform in front of an audience even famous opera singers and star athletes but if you know it’s natural and you expect to be a little nervous it won’t really bother you that much and you’ll do yourself proud and besides she added you’ll be having a big rehearsal in the auditorium that’ll help now where’s that brother of yours i’ve got to finish his costume i do wish he’d take this thing a little more seriously don’t worry about him mama said sister he can do his part standing on his head the rehearsal did help but an empty auditorium still wasn’t the same as a real live audience and now at last the moment had come the curtain was opening on the bear country school’s production of grizzlystiltskin and there was sister all alone on the big stage looking out at the whole school and grizzly gramps and gran and uncle willie and aunt min it was a little scary but it was also very exciting then she heard a loud clear voice saying i am the miller’s daughter and woe is me for my father has told the king i can spin straw into gold and in truth i cannot it took her a split second to realize that the voice was hers from there on everything went beautifully there was one little rough spot near the end when it was time for brother to do his part he came on stage in his handsome woodsbear costume looking bout at the hundreds of eyes staring at him and completely forgot what he was supposed to say i can’t remember my lines he whispered why don’t you try standing on your head whispered sister but then she took pity on him and helped him with his lines the play ended magnificently with grizzlystiltskin flying into a fury and disappearing in a puff of smoke the applause was long and loud after the show mama and papa came backstage terrific show said papa terrific congratulations said mama on a job well done a piece of cake said princess sister bear country school our store we add and subtract big bigger biggest worlds and ideas small smaller smallest sister’s part hear me oh prince hear me oh prince hear me oh prince princess miller’s daughter oh good sir we’ve me

once in a while the bear family who lived in the big tree house down a sunny dirt road deep in bear country got out the family snapshots and looked at them what are these asked sister bear picking up a book of photos i don’t think i’ve ever seen these before there were pictures of bears playing tennis canoeing dancing and having all sorts of fun the bears looked like mama and papa only they were younger and thinner they’re pictures of papa and me on our honeymoon said mama with a smile at grizzly mountain lodge said papa we had a wonderful time what’s a honeymoon asked brother a honeymoon is a special trip couples take when they get married explained mama getting married is a very special happening and celebrating it with a trip is an old custom as a matter of fact said papa we’ve decided to go on a second honeymoon we’re going back to the same place and play tennis go canoeing and have fun it’ll be lovely said mama a second honeymoon sounds like a pretty good idea to me said brother me too said sister they scooted out of the room and were back in a jiffy with their vacation things oh you won’t be coming said papa honeymoons even second honeymoons are just for grownups not for cubs but but what’s going to happen to us asked sister it just so happens said mama that gran has been after me to let you spend a week with her and gramps and this will be the perfect opportunity a whole week said brother but we’ve never stayed with anybody that long said sister well said papa taking a few practice swings with his tennis racket there’s got to be a time for everything what will we do for a whole week asked the cubs where will we sleep what will we eat goodness said mama such a fuss about a simple thing like spending a week at grandma’s it didn’t seem like a simple thing to the cubs they loved gramps and gran very much but well they just weren’t mama and papa besides gramps and gran were sort of old what are you taking with you sister asked brother when it was time to pack i’m taking two books my jacks and my teddy of course these he said holding up some books and his best yo-yo papa put their suitcases in the car trunk last so that when they got to gran’s unloading was as easy as one-to-three then after lots of big bear hugs and kisses the happy second honeymooners were on their way it certainly is good to see young folks having fun said gan as she waved good-bye we’re the young folks muttered the cubs we’re the ones who are supposed to have fun i’m sure you’re hungry after your ride said gran when they went in how about some of y special honey nut cookies and milk no thanks gran said sister i’m not hungry right now hey these are really good said brother sister sneaked a taste they were good but well they just weren’t mama’s now let’s get you up to your room so you can get settled said gramps the cubs reached for their bags but before you could say grizzly gramps they were gathered up bags and all and carried up the steep stairs gramps certainly was strong for someone soold the room at the top of the stairs was very nice very nice indeed but well it just wasn’t home gramps said sister where do you suppose mama and papa are right now well said gramps i reckon they’re still on the road just pulling into sight of grizzly mountain lodge after they unpacked their things gramps thought the cubs might like to explore around the house while it wasn’t home it was an interesting house there was the attic crowded with all sorts of interesting things gran’s kitchen with its yummy tastes and smells and gramps’ den gramps knew how to build a ship in a bottle when the cubs asked him how it was done he just smiled what do you suppose mama and papa are doing now they asked then i reckon they’ve gotten into their tennis clothes and are swatting the ball back and forth he said over the next few days brother and sister found lots to do they helped gran feed her bird friends more kinds than they had ever seen in one place and gran knew all their names they helped grams cut and smooth twigs for a new ship in a bobble it turned out that he built them outside the bottle and then slid them in it was pretty tricky they went fishing in a special place gramps knew about well said gramps as they returned with a fine catch i reckon that your mama and papa are out canoeing right now i certainly hope they’re having fun said sister because we sure are hmm better get these chairs in said gramps after a fine fish fry it’s going to rain tomorrow how do you know asked brother i can feel it in my bones answered gramps it turned out gramps was right good said brother we’ll be able to relax a little sister got out her jacks and he started to play with his yo-yo used to be pretty good with one of those myself said gramps was he ever not only could gramps make the yo-yo sleep and walk-the-dog he could even do baby-in-cradle and round-the-world that evening after a refreshing nap they all went to gramps and gran’s regular friday night square dance gramps and gran didn’t just watch they do-si-doed with the best of them they even won a prize for friskiest couple goodness said sister in the morning this week really flew by and we learned so much added brother practicing baby-in-the-cradle gramps and gran how come you know so much asked sister so many things why you can even feel the weather in your bones that’s one

sister bear who lived with her mama papa and brother in the big tree house down a sunny dirt road deep in bear country had been going to school for a quite a while first there had been nursery school which was pure fun playing with dolls and blocks rolling clay snakes and scribbling with crayons next had come kindergarten that was fun too there were marching games and rhythm band she also learned a lot of numbers in kindergarten and most of the alphabet now sister was in first grade regular school was different it was still fun and she liked teacher jane very much but it wasn’t all fun there was quite a lot of work spelling number problems all kinds of things in regular school you have to concentrate and sometimes when you concentrate you form little nervous habits that’s what happened to some of the cubs in teacher jane’s class lizzy twirled her fur twirl twirl twirl freddy scratched his head scratch scratch scratch norman sucked his thumb suck suck suck and sister nibbled her nails nibble nibble nibble nibble before she knew it she had nibbled them down to nubbins in fact she nibbled them down so far that some of her fingers were getting sore oh dear said mama bear to sister when the cubs got home from school one day you’ve nibbled your nails down to nubbins in fact you’ve nibbled them cleaned off how did it happen i’m not exactly sure mama sister said but some of them are getting sore hmm said mama well here’s what we’ll do we’ll put a little medicine on the sore ones and bits of adhesive tape on all of them that will remind you not to nibble and will give them a change to grow back the bits of tape helped sister remember not to nibble but they also got in the way when she tried to do certain things it’s very hard to hole a pencil with tape all over your fingertips or tune the tv or scratch when you have an itch but worst of all the bits of tape told the whole world that sister bear was a nail biter the next morning when sister lined up for school lizzy bruin and some others began pointing and teasing sister nibbles her nails sister nibbles her nails it didn’t take sister long to decide to pull off those bits of tape and without the tape she forgot to remember not to nibble she forgot during school she forgot on the bus she even forgot as she and brother climbed off the bus you’re going to have to cut that out sis said brother or you’ll get to be a regular full-time nail biter i’m afraid your brother’s right said mama who was organizing the wheelbarrow for some garden work i don’t mean to nag but nail biting is a very difficult habit to break habit asked sister making fists so that her nubby nibbled-off nails wouldn’t show what’s a habit that’s a good question said mama come along while i plant these tulip bulbs grizzly gran sent over and we’ll talk about it a habit mama said as she pushed the wheelbarrow along the well-worn path is something you do so often you don’t even have to think about it habits are a very important part of our lives and most of them are good like brushing your teeth and combing your fur when you get up in the morning and looking both ways before you cross a road but some habits aren’t so good like nail biting asked sister you would like to have your nice nails grow back wouldn’t you as mama’s answer oh yes said sister but i keep forgetting why is it so hard to remember well said mama it’s sort of like this path i’ve wheeled this barrow over it so many times that it’s worn a deep rut right down the middle and it keeps getting deeper every time i use it why it’s so deep now that i can’t get out of it without a little help that’s the way it is with a bad habit the more you use it the harder it is to get out of it here this is where i want to plant the bulbs what about my nail-biting habit asked sister as she helped mama out of the deep rut how am i going to get out of it you just need a little help that’s all said mama let’s land gran’s tulips while i think about it and later i’ll talk to your papa he may have some ideas i could read the riot act to her suggested papa you know  ‘nail biting is an outrageous disgraceful habit and if you don’t stop it immediately ‘ dear me no said mama nail biting is a kind of nervous habit and shouting and threatening will just make her more nervous i suppose so said papa thoughtfully perhaps some sort of reward would help a bit of money let’s say a dime for every day she doesn’t bite her nails before mama could answer sister bear who had been nervously nibbling in the next room popped in and said a dime ten whole cents every day just for not biting my nails that’s right said papa until the habit’s broken i’ll never nibble again she said as she thought of all those lovely dimes she was going to get but the way it turned out she didn’t get a single dime all she got was discouraged a day is a long time and habits are powerful especially bad habits even with the promise of a dime sister couldn’t remember not to nibble mama and papa got discouraged too oh well sighed mama life goes on i must call gran and thank her for the tulip bulbs oh you’re very welcome my dear said gran when mama called and how is everything at your house is that so you know i was a nail biter when i was a cub and my mama helped me to stop what have you tried so far umuh-huh well i think you’re on the right track with the dime but instead of a dime and instead of giving it to her at the end of the day what an interesting idea said mama as she listened to wise old grizzly gran so they tried gran’s idea instead of a dime at the end of each day they gave sister ten pennies one for each nail at the beginning of each day ten pennies to keep unless she nibbled and with those pennies in her pocket jiggling when she got on the school bus jingling when she jumped rope in the schoolyard just waiting to be remembered when some nail decided it needed a nibble the plan worked not perfectly it’s hard to break a habit and sister had to give back some of those pennies but in ten days she had ninety-three pennies but even better  she had ten fine fingernails great for picking things up turning the tv and scratching itches and the next time she played jacks she got all the way to tensies phew said papa bear i’m glad that’s over yes indeed agreed mama breathing a great sigh of relief that’s when brother bear looked at his fingernails and piped up you know i think i might start biting my nails i could use the money i certainly hope you’re joking roared papa because if you’re not  i’m joking i’m joking interrupted brother  and he was

though brother and sister bear were usually very healthy they occasionally caught cold so when brother came home from school one day sneezing and wheezing mama bear knew just what to do she took his temperature tucked him into bed and went right to the phone and called dr grizzly sneezing and wheezing and a temperature of a hundred and one said dr grizzly keep him in bed give him plenty of liquids and keep him home from school until his temperature is back to normal mama followed the doctor’s orders and little by little brother’s temperature began to go down i feel a little better he said may i get out of bed i’m afraid not said mama the doctor wants you to stay in bed but there’s no reason why your stay shouldn’t be as pleasant as possible papa she called would you bring up the portable tv the portable had remote control and pretty soon brother was having a fine time switching from one cartoon show to another when he tired of tv he got out his comic books and when he tired of those mama brought him his dinosaur collection there was no doubt about it except for his sniffles brother bear was having a pretty good time so when sister bear brought home a folder of schoolwork for him he hardly looked at it he was much too busy having fun but while he was at home having fun his fellow students at school were hard at work in the classroom where teacher bob was teaching a new math lesson they had learned to add subtract and multiply now they were learning to divide on the soccer field where coach bruin was getting the team ready for the big game against beartown cousin freddy he called take brother’s place at forward he’s out sick yes sir said freddy this was the chance he’d been waiting for  it wasn’t until brother was all better and ready to go back to school that he remembered the folder of work oh well he thought i’ll study it on the bus but that’s where he heard about freddy and the soccer team he was so upset he forgot all about studying when coach bruin had extra practice during early gym brother became even more upset it wasn’t easy watching freddy take his place on the team then when brother got back to class teacher bob said i certainly hope you studied that work folder because we’re going to have a quiz a quiz said brother on what on division of course said teacher bob as he handed out the quiz papers brother might have managed even then he was good with numbers and might have worked things out if only he’d been able to concentrate but all he could think about was cousin freddy out there kicking field goals while he sat on the bench the quiz was a disaster not only did brother get every problem wrong but teacher bob wrote on the paper  very poor must be signed by parent brother didn’t know which was worse  the soccer mess or the quiz disaster what would he say to mama and papa when they asked him how things had gone at school he was so busy feeling sorry for himself on the bus ride home that he didn’t notice that sister was coming down with a bad case of the sneezes and wheezes oh dear said mama when she saw sister you’ve caught brother’s cold into bed with you she and papa were so busy attending to sister that they forgot to ask brother how things went at school and he didn’t tell them and the next morning when the school bus came brother didn’t get on the bus he hid in the tall grass until the bus was out of sight the squirrels and bluebirds were puzzled brother was usually happy and cheerful but not this morning this morning he looked unhappy and angry too phooey brother shouted kicking a stone but kicking the stone reminded him of soccer and that just made him angrier the bluebirds took off and the squirrels scattered phooey on soccer he shouted stomping off through the woods stomp stomp stomp grasshoppers hopped toads stood stock-still and pretended they were bumps on a log phooey on school brother shouted stomping out of the woods pansies hid their faces ladybugs flew away home  and he said reaching into his schoolbag phooey on division he had come to the top of a big hill he took out the quiz folded it into a paper airplane and sailed it high into the air the hill overlooked a swampy overgrown bog as brother watched the quiz circle and swoop he noticed something out of the corner of his eye a familiar house at the edge of the bog grizzly gramps was working on a ship model when he heard the knock gran was making cookies they weren’t expecting visitors and they certainly weren’t expecting brother especially during school hours it didn’t take long for the whole story to come out gramps and gran listened quietly as brother told them about catching cold the folder of work the soccer mess the quiz disaster the missed bus and the paper airplane come with me young feller said gramps i want to show you something gramps took brother by the hand and led him deep into the bog there he said that’s what i want to show you it was a very old wagon sunk almost out of sight in a muddy pond how did it get there asked brother it wasn’t easy said gramps i went to a lot of trouble getting that old wagon into this swamp then with a twinkle in his eye he said just the way you did getting in over your head at school it happed a long time ago when i took a wrong turn just the way you did when you didn’t study that schoolwork that teacher bob sent home well instead of admitting my mistake and backing up i just pushed ahead until i was in so deep there was no getting out and you lost the wagon said brother yep said gramps but i learned a valuable lesson if you find yourself on the wrong road don’t just keep on going until you’re in over your head back up and start over on the right road how am i going to do that asked brother oh i think we can manage but first look over there gramps said pointing there it was  the paper airplane caught in a berry bush what do you think they’ll say asked brother later as they bounced along in gramps’s pickup  we’ll find out soon enough said gramps pulling to a stop in front of the big tree house and let’s not forget gran’s bag of cookies they’re her finest mama and papa weren’t exactly pleased when they heard about the big mess brother had gotten himself into but they didn’t holler and pound the table either not even papa he looked like he might be going to when he saw the paper he had to sign gramps had tried to flatten it out but it was still pretty wrinkled what happened to this he asked oh said gramps it just sort of got folded a bit that’s when he brought out gran’s cookies there were ten of them let’s see now he said there are five of us counting sister so how many cookies do we each get two of course said brother dividing them up don’t look now young feller said gramps with a wink but you just divided then by five is that all there is to dividing said brother that’s all said gramps come along said mama in a no-nonsense voice where are we going asked brother to school mama said as they got in the car but it’s so late protested brother it’s never too late to correct a mistake mama said and off they went brother got to class just in time for a retest the class hadn’t done very well on the division quiz so teacher bob was giving them a second chance brother really concentrated and did much better and that afternoon he got a second chance at soccer too it was the day of the big game against beartown and things weren’t going very well brother said coach bruin i want you to go in for freddy i don’t think he’s quite ready for first team glad to help coach brother said as he ran out onto the field you

the bear family didn’t always live in the big tree house down a sunny dirt road deep in bear country years ago when brother bear was an only cub they lived in a hillside cave halfway up great bear mountain at the far edge of bear country it was a comfortable cave cool in summer and cozy in winter and while it wasn’t perfect it tended to be dark and it dripped and trickled a bit it was home and the bear family was quite happy there happy and busy mama bear kept busy managing things and tending the vegetable patch papa bear had plenty to do with his wood cutting and furniture making and brother bear kept busy climbing collecting rocks and playing with his friends but living on the mountainside wasn’t perfect it wasn’t easy growing vegetables in the thin rocky soil and the trees papa needed were getting fewer and farther between but the sun was bright the air was clear and sparkling and the view was magnificent yes the bear family was happy and content living in their hillside cave halfway up great bear mountain at the far edge of bear country until one day papa bear said my dears the time has come to move move cried brother bear that’s right said papa the trees are getting few and far between on the mountainside yes said mama and it’s not easy raising enough vegetables for a growing family in this thin rocky soil where are we going to move to brother asked to the valley said papa as he began putting lamps and things into a box the valley said brother the valley down there was nice to look at but he wasn’t so sure he wanted to live there it was so far away what about my toys asked brother we’ll take them along of course put them in there said papa handing him a box and what about my books we’ll take them along too said papa handing him another box and what about my friends asked brother we can’t put them in a box and take them along that’s true said mama lifting brother onto her lap you’ll be leaving your friends behind papa and i will too that’s what happens when you move but you can keep in touch with them you can write even visit perhaps and besides you can make lots of new friends when are we going to move brother wanted to know tomorrow bright and early mama told him the moving bears will be here first thing in the morning that night as brother bedded down in in his corner of the cave he wondered what it would be like to leave his old neighborhood and his old friends he wondered what it would be like to move into a new neighborhood making new friends and then he began to wonder if he would ever fall asleep and just when it began to seem that he never would he did the next morning the moving bears came with their big truck and began moving the bear family’s things out of the cave everything goes said papa and everything did the moving bears were very fast but very careful before long the cave was empty then after a fond farewell look at their old home the bear family said good-bye to their friends and neighbors got into their car and headed down the mountain the big moving truck followed down down the mountainside they went after a few tight spots and a few wrong turns they were in the rich green forest of the valley look at that forest said papa now i shall have plenty of wood to cut they passed farms with fine fields and look at that rich brown soil what a vegetable garden i’ll have said mama brother was on the lookout for friends and playmates but all he saw were a frog and some butterflies and they didn’t look very friendly get ready said papa as they turned onto a sunny dirt road just around this bend is our new home but it's a tree said brother a tree house said papa a fine tree house with a downstairs and an upstairs and an attic and even a room of your own it was indeed a fine house a whole house hollowed out of a great oak it did need work the paint was old there were some broken steps and some of the bark was loose but mama and papa had great plans for fixing it up as the movers took the bears’ things into their new home the bears imagined what it would look like when it was all fixed it was going to be very beautiful they were so busy imagining that they didn’t notice they had company their new neighbors had come with gifts of welcome there were rabbits with carrot stew bird and squirrel families with seeds and nuts and a number of bear families with honeycombs wild berries and lots of cubs to make friends with the bear family felt very welcome in their new neighborhood that night they went to bed very tired but very happy and when they got their tree hose all fixed up it was just about perfect  toys books toys books toys bear country moving for sale sold,1981,moving day,family    
brother bear said sister impatiently are you going to take all day to pick your books sister and brother bear at the bear country library sister had already chosen her books and was waiting at the check-out desk hold your horses said brother i am looking for a good mystery sister bear usually took out storybooks and books about nature and sometimes books of poems brother liked those too but lately he’d become interested in mysteries especially spooky ones hey this one looks good he said finally okay let’s check out hmmm said sister looking at the cover it was called the case of the crying cave it looks scary to me say this is really good said brother later that evening when the bear family had settled down for some reading would you like me to read it to you he asked sister sister was looking at a storybook about three kittens who were arguing about which was the prettiest and it was a little boring or are you scared teased brother of course not said sister she left her book on the floor and climbed onto the bench to sit beside him the mystery began quietly it told about some bear scouts who were on an overnight camp-out when the scouts discovered a dark secret cave brother’s mystery began to get a little exciting and when the cave began to cry and wail it was anything but quiet ’who-o-o-o-o cried the deep dark mysterious cave’ read brother with a lot of expression ’who-o-o-o-o’ stop said sister putting her fingers in her ears that’s enough and she went back to her storybook scaredy bear scaredy bear teased brother and that’s quite enough of that added papa bear looking up from his paper at the cubs’ bedtime papa and mama said good night turned off the light and left the cubs in the usual sleepy darkness outside the tree house the bright busy sounds of day had given way to the soft soothing sounds of night the quiet conversation of frogs and toads the soft cry of the owl the sigh of the night wind and if you listened very hard you could almost hear the softest sound of all the sound of lightning bugs switching their lights on and off on and off but inside the tree house sister bear wasn’t even beginning to fall asleep that night the dark didn’t seem the least bit quiet and sleepy in fact it seemed like the spooky darkness of a scary cave and the friendly old chest of drawers and funny clothes tree that papa had made didn’t seem so friendly and funny they seemed more like cave creatures so when brother decided to tease her a little more by making a wailing noise a really spooky wailing noise it gave her quite a scare mama papa she cried hurry come quick and come quickly they did papa rushed into the dark room and tripped over the clothes tree mama rushed in after papa and tripped over him in the commotion sister fell out of bed and landed on both of them then brother who had started it all with his spooky wall turned on the light what a mess sister still scared was holding on to papa papa was holding on to the toe he had stubbed and mama was looking for the night cap she had lost in the confusion all three of them were pretty annoyed with brother bear it turned out to be a very long night in the bear’s tree house papa and mama tried to explain that there was nothing to be afraid of in the dark except maybe running into a clothes tree and stubbing your toe but it didn’t do any good sister absolutely refused to go to sleep with the light off and brother positively insisted that he couldn’t fall asleep with the light on the next morning the bear family was very sleepy-eyed  boy said brother yawning i sure don’t want to go through another night like that neither do i said papa and i think i have an idea that might help he took sister’s hand come with me he said where are we going she wanted to know up to the attic the attic but it’s dark in the attic even in the daytime i know said papa but there’s something i want to show you anyway there’s nothing so special about the dark it’s just part of nature like the light it’s your imagination that makes the dark seem spooky sometimes what’s imagination asked sister imagination is what makes us think that chests of drawers and clothes trees are cave creatures i wish i didn’t have one said sister don’t say that said papa a lively imagination is one of the best things a cub can have it’s imagination that lets us paint pictures make up poems invent inventions the trick is to take charge of your imagination and not let it take charge of you when they got to the attic papa began to rummage through boxes looking for something sister tried to follow papa’s advice and not let her imagination take charge and it worked a spooky shape turned out to be the shadow of some old tools what looked like a giant was really some piled-up furniture here it is said papa my old night light the one i used when i was a cub and had a little trouble falling asleep in the dark sister couldn’t quite believe that her big powerful papa was ever afraid of the dark  oh sure said papa most of us are at one time or another how about reading the rest of the case of the crying cave sister bear asked brother later that day are you sure you want me to sure i want to see how it turns out she insisted when it turned out that there was nothing very spooky about the terrible wailing noise it was caused by wind blowing across an opening in the roof of the case like the noise you make when you blow across the top of a bottle sister was a little disappointed and that night when she and brother were all settle down in the cozy glow of papa’s old night light she said so i was pretty disappointed by the way the case of the crying cave ended why asked brother because she said i was hoping the wailing would be a really spooky scary monster and she leaned down from her bunk over brother’s and made a spooky scary monster face at him cut that out cried brother then sister went right to sleep but brother lay awake for quite some time listening to the owl hoots and thinking that maybe he’d had enough mysteries for a while  bear country library out mysteries cubs corner  the case of the crying cave wooooo bear country gardens the case of the crying the case

most morning in bear country the sun rose to greet the day and the mockingbird sang its copycat songs outside an upstairs window of the bear’s tree house and inside the tree house brother bear and sister bear would wake up brother and sister usually got along very well they took turns nicely with the bathroom they said please and thank you at breakfast they often sat together on the school bus and after school they worked together happily on their special project their own backyard tree house but one gray morning brother and sister didn’t get along well at all maybe it was the weather or maybe it was because the mockingbird slept late but whatever it was brother and sister bear got into a big fight sister bear opened her eyes and stretched then she sat up and let her legs dangle over the edge of her bed right in brother bear’s face she didn’t do it to be rude it was just one of those things that happens with bunk beds but that morning brother was not in a very good mood sister he shouted get your dopey feet out of my face my feet aren’t dopey and they’re not in your face she shouted back get your dopey face out of my face snarled brother you shut up snapped sister and before brother could answer she skipped into the bathroom ahead of him she took a very long time brushing her teeth washing up and brushing her fur you’d better come out of that bathroom shouted brother banging on the door brother bear said papa coming out of his bedroom you know better than to shout at your sister but she’s taking too long in the bathroom complained brother and she’s doing it on purpose when brother raised his fist to bang on the door again it opened and out came sister all spruced up good morning papa she said as nice as you please gr-r-r said brother brother and sister didn’t say please and thank you that morning at breakfast because they weren’t speaking to each other and they didn’t sit together on the school bus sister sat in the front and brother sat way in the back that afternoon they made a line down the middle of their backyard tree house to show which half was whose it wasn’t much fun sitting up there in their tree house not speaking especially when it began to rain hard later they kept on being mean by taking back the things they usually shared sister took back her modeling clay which brother had made into dinosaurs and rolled it into one big lump brother took back his trucks and planes and put them on the top shelf where sister couldn’t reach them they got so angry that they forgot they weren’t speaking and began shouting at each other even louder than before then papa lost his temper and began shouting at them to stop shouting the neighbors didn’t know which was worse the big storm of the racket coming from the bear’s house mama had quite enough she put two fingers to her mouth and whistled very very loudly papa and the cubs were so surprised that they stopped shouting i didn’t know you could whistle like that mama said sister well i can and i can also tell you said mama sternly that i’ve had quite enough of this foolish fighting why i doubt you two even remember what you’re fighting about the cubs tried to remember but they couldn’t mama took the cubs into her lab everybody gets into an argument once in a while she said even folks who love each other very much you and i don’t have arguments said papa oh yes we do said mama no we don’t argued papa we’re having one right now said mama about whether or not we have arguments while papa thought that one over mama went on to say that occasional arguments are part of living together we get angry even call each other names and say things we really don’t mean and after a while it's over like the storm asked sister the rain had almost stopped and the sun was beginning to shine through the clouds yes said mama like the storm look said papa the sun shining on the last of the rain had made a rainbow a rainbow is something very beautiful that happens after a storm said mama looking at the cubs you mean like making up after a big fight sort of said mama so brother and sister bear hugged and made up and got along just beautifully until the next time anyway  school bus twee-e-et,1982,get in a fight,family    
it was a lazy sort of day in bear country the air was so still that the leaves on the big tree house where the bear family lived were hardly rustling except in the beehive where the bees were always busy nothing much seemed to be happening it was the sort of day that somethings leads to mischief inside the tree house brother and sister bear were sitting around not doing anything in particular brother was holding his soccer ball he’d become interested in soccer and had been outside practicing free kicks sister was relaxing in an easy chair thinking about what to do next neither papa nor mama bear was around papa was in his shop working on some furniture and mama was out shopping i know what said sister let’s go gather some wild blackberries brother thought about that no he said wild blackberries have too may thorns and besides the seeds get stuck in your teeth well then said sister let’s go out and twist each other up on the swing and see who gets the dizziest brother thought about that no he said that’s silly and besides we did that yesterday sister became irritated and impatient with her brother my goodness she complained you don’t want to do anything all you want to do is sit there and hug that soccer ball i think you must be in love with that soccer ball i am not protested brother but i’ll tell you something i bet i can dribble this ball past you brother was a pretty good soccer player and a very good dribbler but so was sister the only one who saw what happened next besides the cubs was a mockingbird who was perched on a twig outside an open window brother faced sister the ball was on the floor between them first brother moved the ball with his right foot then with his left trying to trick sister out of position then quick as a flash he gave the ball a sharp kick with his right it almost worked but sister was fast too she reached out with her knee and blocked the ball which bounced against a bookshelf against a chair against a footstool and into mama’s most favorite lamp which fell to the floor with a crash the mockingbird let out a screech and got out of there as fast as its wings could carry it as it flew away it saw mama bear returning from the marketplace now the bear family had some house rules just as any family has one was no honey eating in bed another was no tracking mud on the clean floors and another was no ball playing in the house what to do brother looked at sister sister looked at brother they both looked at the broken lamp and they both listened in horror as mama came up the front steps and into the hose all brother had time to do before mama came into the room was roll the ball behind papa’s chair my lamp said mama my best lamp what happened she asked looking into her cubs’ eyes tell me about it the cubs looked into mama’s eyes then at each other and then they began to tell one of the biggest whoppers that has ever been told in bear country it was a bird began brother yes added sister a big purple bird with yellow feet and green wing tips added brother and funny-looking red feathers sticking out of its head said sister as a finishing tough as most lies do the purple bird whopper got bigger and bigger and bigger yes continued the cubs and it flew in that window zoomed around the room and knocked over the lamp as mama bear was looking at the broken lamp with a sad expression on her face papa bear came in from his shop the cubs began to tell him the story of the big bird that flew in the window and broke the lamp it was harder to tell the second time for one thing they couldn’t quite remember how they had told it the first time you’ve got me confused said papa was it a purple bird with green wing tips and yellow feet or a yellow bird with purple wing tips and green feet or was it a white bird with black spots like that soccer ball behind my easy chair but the thing that really made it hard the second time was how very sad mama looked as she picked up the pieces of the broken lamp mama we’re really sorry about the lamp said brother oh yes said sister picking up the last piece and putting it in the dust pan oh said mama i’m not worried about the lamp we can always get another lamp or we can glue this one back together what i ‘m sad about is the thought that maybe just maybe my cubs whom i’ve always trusted aren’t telling me the truth and trust is not something you can put back together again both cubs started to talk at once it wasn’t a bird said sister it was a soccer ball and it was all my fault shouted brother it was just as much my fault shouted sister but they were both shouted down by the phone which rang loudly it was grizzly gran inviting the bear family for a sunday visit hello gran said mama oh everything is just fine here in the tree house how is everything with you but mama protested sister after mama hung up the phone you told gran that everything is fine here and that isn’t really the truth nobody really expects cubs to be perfect and from time to time brother and sister bear did forget the rules brother ate honey in bed a couple of times one time sister tracked a little mud on the clean floor and once or twice brother and sister started to play ball in the hose before they remembered not to but they ever ever again told a whopper before trust is one thing you can’t put back together once it’s broken,1983,the truth,family    
there was trouble in the big tree house down a sunny dirt road deep in bear country trouble with manners the bear family’s trouble with manners was that they forgot them at first it was just an occasional please or thank you that was forgotten then there was a rude push without an excuse me then a reach across the table instead of a please pass the broccoli mama bear wasn’t quite sure how or why it happened but she was sure of one thing whatever the reason the bear family had become a pushing shoving name-calling ill-mannered mess at the table it was even worse they were a grabbing mouth-stuffing food-fighting kicking-under-the-table super mess of course mama bear tried to correct brother and sister bear’s behavior she tried coaxing she tried complaining she tried shouting she tried going to papa for help though it sometimes seemed to mama that he was part of the problem papa banged on the table and shouted as only he could shout but nothing really seemed to do any good mama didn’t like what was happening to her family not one bit something had to be done but what the best way to fight bad habits she thought was with good habits then she thought of a plan she got a big piece of cardboard and a marker at the top she wrote  the bear family politeness plan when the plan was finished she called a family meeting and showed it to papa and the cubs it certainly got the bear family’s attention mama’s plan had a list of all the rude things she wanted to stop beside each one was a penalty a job or chore that went with it if you forgot a please or a thank you you had to sweep the front steps if you pushed or shoved you had to beat two rugs if you got caught name calling you had to clean the whole cellar but mama sputtered the cubs you’re not being fair it seems to me she said that you’re the ones who aren’t being fair to yourselves or anyone else that’s what manners are all about being fair and considerate manners are very important they help us get along with each other why without manners  your mama’s absolutely right interrupted papa thank you papa for your comment but interrupting is number three on rude list and the penalty is dusting the downstairs mama said and handed him the feather duster hmm said brother this looks serious i think we’d better come up with a plan of our own or we’re going to be doing a lot of extra chores what sort of plan asked sister well he said instead of just being polite we’ll be super polite we’ll please and thank you so much that mama will get fed up and call the whole thing off yes said sister we’ll be so polite she won’t be able to stand it they put their plan into action they were super polite  on the stairs  after you sister dear thank you dear brother in the hall  excuse me brother dear why certainly my dear sister waiting for the bathroom  terribly sorry to have kept you waiting think nothing of it my dear but it didn’t work the way they expected mama didn’t get fed up at all and after a while brother and sister forgot about being super polite and were just polite at the table  pass the honey please certainly in their room  would you like me to help you pick up your toys thank you very much in the yard  oops sorry i didn’t mean to bump you that’s all right no harm done and it turned out that mama had been right  thinks did go more smoothly once they got into the good manners habit they didn’t even have to think about it but it wasn’t so easy for papa he was the one who got fed up it’s a little harder to change habits when you’re older and he had to do quite a few extra chores for forgetting his manners i’m glad to get out of the house away from that politeness plan he said as he drove the family along the highway on a trip to the supermarket manners and courtesy are just as important away from home especially on the road said mama as they stopped at a stop sign to let pedestrians and other cars pass they help us drive safely well grumbled papa as they all went into the busy supermarket i think you can have too much of a good thing you’ve got to have common sense along with manners why if you let everyone go ahead of you at the checkout you’d be there forever and sometimes you have to interrupt excuse me madam he interrupted a shopper but i believe you have a leaking bottle in your cart the shopper thanked him for his help you see he said driving home there’s more to life than remembering your manners besides manners are all right for cubs and mama bears but we papa bears have other things to think about at that moment the car in front stopped suddenly and papa bumped into it he was furious why that pinheaded fiddlebrain he snarled name calling reminded sister the penalty for name calling was cleaning the whole cellar so papa gritted his teeth and remembered his manners and a good thing too because climbing out of the other car was the biggest angriest bear he had ever seen but when the angry bear saw how polite papa was he remembered his manners too he explained that he had stopped short because a mama duck and her ducklings had crossed in front of him then he and papa bear looked at their bumpers and saw that no harm had been done as i was saying said papa as they continued on their way it’s very important for us to remember our manners at all times and i want to thank you sister for reminding me to remember mine you’re very welcome i’m sure said sister bear politely  the bear family politeness plan rudeness forgetting please or thank you pushing or shoving interrupting name calling reaching at table playing with

brother bear was just crazy about space grizzlies space grizzlies were little toy action figures that you could collect sister bear didn’t like them much she thought they were dumb and a little scary mama bear didn’t mind them except when brother brought them to the table or left them on the stairs papa bear didn’t care about them one way or the other but brother cared about them a lot he cared about them so much that he did chores for neighbors to make extra money so he could buy more he had quite a few but the store had more a lot more he was saving up to buy sleezo’s cloud castle sleezo was the evilest of all the space grizzlies and the wicked-looking cloud castle was where he planned all his evil deeds when brother had saved enough money he went along on a shopping trip to the bear country mall and made his purchase the cloud castle came in a big box and he could hardly wait to get home to play with it but as he was getting into the car he saw something that was even more exciting than the cloud castle it was a movie poster it said  coming soon space grizzlies the movie a space grizzlies movie he cried it looks great i can’t wait to see it i can said sister looks scary to me may i see it when it comes mama asked brother may i please hmm said mama we’ll see when the time comes when they got home brother opened his new cloud castle got out all his space grizzlies and was all set to play the biggest space grizzly game ever but he had nobody to play with nobody that is except sister want to play space grizzlies sis he asked no way she said aw come on he said i’ll play any game you want if you’ll play space grizzlies with me any three games she said driving a hard bargain which three he asked warily papa dolls jacks and beanbags she answered papa dolls jacks and beanbags he protested give me a break take it or leave it she said he took it and after some lively sessions of paper dolls jacks and beanbags it was time for space grizzlies i am sleezo evil king of the universe roared brother calling all spaceships seek and destroy the planet magongo home of my sworn enemy heero the magnificent oh no you don’t sister shouted back i am heero the magnificent one touch from my sleep wand and your evil ways will be ended they played until mama called them for dinner  brother said mama how many times must i tell you no space grizzlers at the table papa was taking a peek at the bear country news brother he said that movie of yours starts tomorrow may i see it mama please asked brother i don’t know why not she said why haven’t been to the movies in a while i know why not said sister because it’s scary that’s no problem said papa there are lots of movies to choose from he was right the bear country theater was really four movie houses in one and there were usually four different movies playing this looks good said mama the magic toeshoes it’s a musical about a ballerina so when they got to the movies to the next evening mama papa and sister got in line for the magic toeshoes and brother joined a bunch of his friends in line for space grizzlies the magic toeshoes told the story of a young bear who wanted to e a ballerina but every time she tried to dance on her toes she wiggled and wobbled the old ballet master took pity on her and gave her a pair of magic toeshoes which cured her wiggles and wobbles but on the night of the big ballet she left her magic toeshoes on the bus without them she was all wiggles and wobbles again that’s when the ballet master told her they weren’t magic at all they were just ordinary toeshoes the wobbly ballerina got her confidence back and danced beautifully ever after the space grizzly movie was about space grizzlies of course  great monstrous big-screen ones who zapped and zoomed through space until that final intergalactic shootout it was very exciting and not a little scary it was dark when the bear family got home so it was off to be for the cubs it was already late for sister and she went right to sleep but brother was so excited by the movie that he lay awake for quite a while he was just about to doze off when sister woke up screaming hel-lp she screamed they’re after me who’s after you asked brother space grizzlies she wailed thousands of them calm down sillyhead it’s only a dream he said but sister leaped out of bed and ran into mama and papa’s room the little silly brother thought imagine being afraid of a dopey dream then he yawned turned over and went to sleep mama and papa tried to calm sister they took her into their bed and hugged her tell us about your dream said mama dream sister said yes said papa you must have had a nightmare that’s the word for a bad dream but it was so real she said calming down a bit that’s how it is with dreams he said it’s as if they’re really happening but they’re not they’re just in your mind can you tell us your dream asked mama it was awful sister said i was a ballet star dancing on my toes and then the stage turned into a giant beanbag board and the space grizzlies came out of the beanbag holes and chased me and i fell down one of the holes i kept falling and falling and then i woke up it was awful she sailed again and buried her face in mama’s nightgown i’m sure it was sweetie said mama but it was also very interesting interesting sister said in a puzzled voice oh yes said mama you see even though you go to sleep your mind keeps right on thinking but it doesn’t think in a sensible way it takes all the things you were thinking or were nervous about during the day and puts them together all jumbled like a mixed-up zigsaw puzzle you mean like the ballet dancer from the movie said sister sure said papa and the beanbag board from playing beanbags with brother  she added and the space grizzlies  began mama where from playing space grizzlies with brother and from seeing the movie poster sister said exactly said papa say she said that is interesting that’s when they heard brother hel-l-lp he screamed they’re after me they’re after me then he raced into the room jumped into the bed and hid his face in papa’s pajamas calm down son said papa it was just a bad dream a nightmare added sister that’s another word for bad dream can you tell us about it asked mama well i was eating dinner and the food turned into space grizzlies gigantic ones and they chased me and i turned into a paper doll and my clothes were flying off it was awful you’re awake now dear said mama everything’s going to be all right but mama he said it was so real of course it was said sister that’s the way dreams are let me explain it to you and she did some dreams make cubs laugh some dreams make them cry it’s interesting to think about what they dream and why space grizzlies headquarters toys bear country barn theater coming soon space grizzlies the movie space door but stop,1988,the bad dream,family  
well that’s everything said mama bear as she and sister and brother bear held the car trunk lid so that papa bear could tie it down not quite said papa running back into the tree house we almost forgot the camera he said when he reappeared what good is a wonderful vacation without photographs to remember it by good thinking papa said brother may i take some pictures when we get there and how about me sister wanted to know of course you may said papa as they bundled into the car we’re all going to take pictures of the most wonderful vacation the bear family has ever had all right now everybody buckle up and we’ll be on our way four safety belts clicked into place and they left their safe comfortable tree house and headed for the excitement and adventure of a vacation high up in the wilds of the great grizzly mountains it had been papa’s idea to take their vacation in the great grizzlies it’ll be a real wilderness experience we’ll live off the land we’re getting too soft here in the valley with all our supermarkets and other conveniences when he saw the ad in the news paper there was no holding him it said try a wilderness vacation a lovely mountain cabin complete with a rowboat by beautiful crystal lake ah said papa painting beautiful word pictures to wake with the rising sun and catch our breakfast from a clear mountain lake to bathe in its sparkling water to snack on delicious wild berries as we tramp the mountain trails to gaze at the beauty of a mountain sunset then to sleep through the peace and quiet of a mountain night far from the noise of traffic and neighbors’ barking dogs it all sounded great to the cubs what kind of fish will we catch papa asked brother trout no doubt he answered with supreme confidence but mama wasn’t so sure he would catch anything so when she packed she took along some canned goods in case the trout weren’t biting and some books and games in case of a rainy day i can almost taste that fresh-caught trout said brother as the road led ever higher into the mountain forest and i can almost taste those yummy wild berries said sister and don’t forget my terrific wilderness stew said papa as he turned onto an even steeper road but we didn’t bring things for stew objected mama all we brought are some canned goods of course we didn’t laughed papa i’m talking about my special live-off-the-land survival stew it’s my secret recipe i make it from bark leaves and roots that i find in the woods when will we get there asked the cubs very soon i can tell by the smell of that mountain air said papa taking a deep breath that’s not mountain air complained brother making a face that’s skunk hmmm said papa wrinkling his noise a good time to start talking those pictures thought mama pew said papa click said the camera there’s the cabin shouted sister as they rounded a bend and there it was indeed a mountain cabin beside a lake completed with rowboat of course it wasn’t quite as they had pictured it from the ad crystal lake looked more like mud soup the lovely mountain cabin looked more like a tumble-down shack there was a rowboat all right but it was half sunk in the lake but papa wasn’t the least bit discouraged he was more excited than ever it’s perfect he shouted the most perfect live-off-the-land vacation spot i’ve ever seen mama wasn’t so sure she noticed that there were no wires leading into the cabin which meant there was electricity that’s the last thing we need scoffed papa what you need on a live-off-the-land vacation smarts and i’ve got enough of those for all of us he took a cooking pot and a folding chair from the car trunk here he said making a seat for mama this is a vacation you relax while i gather the fixings for my fabulous wilderness stew and you two tidy up the cabin he called to the cubs as he headed into the forest with the cooking pot but mama didn’t expect to do much relaxing on this vacation and she wasn’t surprised to find that the cabin was an even worse mess inside than it was outside there was an ankle-deep carpet of twigs branches and dead leaves on the floor and it was practically a museum of spider webs cocoons and mouse nests time for another picture thought mama scurry scurry went the mice click went the camera what’s this asked sister as she cleaned leaves out of the sink that’s a hand pump for water answered mama just what i need it was papa back with his cooking pot full of strange-looking bark eaves and roots a little water for my stew he worked the handle the pup gurgled and squeaked and after a while began to squirt water rusty brown water but he wasn’t discouraged just what i need for my stew he said cheerfully ready-made gravy he carried the pot outside where he had prepared a cooking fire it was very exciting for the cubs but mama wasn’t so sure so she made a fire in the fireplace and warmed up a supper of canned beans and dried honeycomb when papa cried stew time the cubs ran out for a first taste mama followed with the camera here’s to living off the land said papa holding up a big spoon of the strange-looking stuff then he brother and sister each took a taste yugh said sister blech said brother p-tooey said papa click said the camera mama bear’s supper of beans and honeycomb proved very tasty papa bear stretched and yawned now early to bed so i can get up with the sun and catch our breakfast the sun did rise and it was very beautiful but papa snored right through it the frogs crickets and owls had made such a racket during the night that he hadn’t fallen asleep until just before the rising sun lit up the sky papa began to get a little discourage when he went out to catch breakfast the boat sank as soon as he stepped into it and all he caught was a gloppy mudsucker that made snuffling noises and stared snuffle snuffle glop said the mudsucker click said the camera it was papa’s turn to snap the picture when mama and the cubs tasted the wild berries the thorns were something fierce and the berries were so sour even the birds puckered later there was a perfectly beautiful sunset but the bear family didn’t get to see much of it they were too busy swatting the swarms of hungry mountain mosquitoes that swooped in from the lake live off the land you say shouted mama as they ran for the cabin with all these thorns and mosquitoes it’s more like the land is living off us it began to rain just as they reach the cabin but the roof leaked badly and pretty soon they had more leaks than they had pots and pans they spent a miserable night by morning they were soaked to their fur and there was a foot of water in the front stairwell don’t worry said papa the rain can’t last forever and just as soon as seep out this water but instead of papa sweeping the water the water sept papa out the door down the muddy slope and into the muddy mucky lake when mama and the cubs reached him he looked more like a mud ball than papa bear say he said looking at them i have a terrific idea let’s go home so the bear family loaded the trunk put the car top up bundled into the car and bumped and splashed down the mountain in the driving rain the rain had stopped and the sun had come out by the time they reached the valley and their tree house had never looked so good to them as it did that day the next day mama took the film to the camera store to be developed when the pictures came back a few days later the bear family wrote titles on them they began to chuckle as they passed the pictures around the chuckles grew to roaring laughter and soon they were laughing so hard they cried and every so often though the years they take out those pictures and have an absolutely wonderful time enjoying the worst vacation the bear family ever had  whooo whoo ribit whoo ribit ribit ribit whoo ribit hoot ribit ribit ribit click click click whoo ribit whoo whooo click click click papa smells the mountain air we are greeted upon our arrival we taste papa’s wilderness stew our first taste of wild mountain berries papa catches our breakfast papa decides it’s time to go home,1989,too much vacation,family
